abstract = {With the rapid increasing of the number of devices connected to the Internet of Things (IoTs), the traditional centralized cloud computing system is unable to satisfy the Quality of Service (QoS) for many applications, especially for areas with real-time, reliability and security. The edge computing as an extension of the cloud computing is introduced, which lies in its ability to transfer the sensitive data from cloud to the edge for increasing network security and to realize high frequency interaction and real-time transmission of data. However, that the edge servers maintain sensitive privacy information generates many important security issues for the edge computing network. Moreover, the data produced by IoT devices are separated into many parts and stored in different edges servers that are located in different locations, which is hard to guarantee data integrity due to data loss and incorrect data storage in edge servers. As the emergence of blockchain technologies, the various security problems and data integrity of the edge computing can be addressed by integrating blockchain technologies. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of edge computing integrated with blockchain technologies. Firstly, the blockchain technologies and the architecture of the edge computing are introduced. Secondly, the motivations and architecture of the edge computing integrated with blockchain are introduced. Thirdly, the related works about the edge computing integrated with blockchain that have been investigated are introduced. Finally, the research challenges are discussed.},

abstract = {Self-sovereign identity (SSI) is considered to be a &#x201C;killer application&#x201D; of blockchain. However, there is a lack of systematic architecture designs for blockchain-based SSI systems to support methodical development. An aspect of such gap is demonstrated in current solutions, which are considered coarse grained and may increase data security risks. In this paper, we first identify the lifecycles of three major SSI objects (i.e., key, identifier, and credential) and present fine-grained design patterns critical for application development. These patterns are associated with particular state transitions, providing a systematic view of system interactions and serving as a guidance for effective use of these patterns. Further, we present an SSI platform architecture, which advocates the notion of Design-Pattern-as-a-Service. Each design pattern serves as an API by wrapping the respective pattern code to ease application development and improve scalability and security. We implement a prototype and evaluate it on feasibility and scalability.},

abstract = {We are witnessing the advent of personal manufacturing, where home users and small and medium enterprises manufacture products locally, at the point and time of need. The impressively fast adoption of these technologies indicates this approach to manufacturing can become a key enabler of the real-time economy of the future. In this paper, we contribute a secure and dependable infrastructure and architecture for that new paradigm. Our solution leverages physical limitations of the computational process into a defense strategy that makes distributed file storage and transfer highly secure. The main idea is to replace asymmetric or public-key encryption functions with an unkeyed, collision, second preimage, and preimage resistant cryptographic hash function. Such a cryptosystem does not have an inverse function $H {^{\mathrm{ -1}}}$. We challenge each block hash against the full hash table to recreate the original message. To illustrate the approach, we describe secured protocols that provide a number of desirable properties during both data storage and streaming. Similar to proof-of-work blockchain consensus algorithms, we parameterized the solution based on the amount of infrastructure available. Experiments show the proposed method can recalculate hashes for a 3-dimensional live matrix of 2563 at an average of 14 revisions per second, and one revision every 5 minutes for a bigger matrix of 40963. The increase in cloud infrastructure cost is insignificant compared to the level of protection offered.},

abstract = {In Bitcoin user identification, an important challenge is to accurately link Bitcoin addresses to their owners. Previously, some heuristics based on transaction structural rules or observations were found and used for Bitcoin address clustering. In this paper, we propose a deep learning method to achieve address-user mapping. We define addresses by their transactional behaviors and seek concealed patterns and characteristics of users that can help us distinguish the owner of a certain address from millions of others. We propose a system that learns a mapping from address representations to a compact Euclidean space where distances directly correspond to a measure of address similarity. We train a deep neural network for address behavior embedding and optimization to finally obtain an address feature vector for each address. We identify owners of addresses through address verification, recognition and clustering, where the implementation relies directly on the distance between address feature vectors. We set up an address-user pairing dataset with extensive collections and careful sanitation. We tested our method using the dataset and proved its efficiency. In contrast to heuristic-based methods, our model shows great performance in Bitcoin user identification.},

These IoT devices need to communicate and synchronize with each other, which also increase the security and privacy challenges. Traditional security models are based on centralized and often include complicated approaches which, tend to be inapplicable and have some limitations. Therefore, one proposed solution is to use blockchain technology which could provide decentralize, secure, and peer-to-peer networks. In this paper, private blockchain implementation using Ethereum smart contract is developed for the smart home to ensure only the home owner can access and monitor home appliances. Simple smart contracts are designed to allow devices to communicate without the need for trusted third party. Our prototype demonstrates three key elements of blockchain-based smart security solution for smart home applications such as smart contract, blockchain-based access control and performance evaluation of the proposed scheme.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

It has been mostly adopted by military, aviation, civil, and commercial sectors for audio and video surveillance. The communication and security challenges of UAV is well mentioned by researchers and organizations (defense) around the world, although many of the challenges remain unresolved (especially for sensitive and consumer-related applications). Moreover, the conventional network systems may not be very efficient in dealing with the dynamic requirements of UAVs. As the UAVs are generally deployed in tough environments and terrains, therefore it is quite essential to provide a strong and secure network. Motivated from these facts, this paper presents an extensive survey on security issues in 5G-enabled UAV networks as per the literature published till the fourth quarter of 2019. It also presents the taxonomy of existing security issues in 5G-enabled UAV networks. Based on the findings from the survey, we present a Blockchain (BC)-based security solution and a summary of research challenges in the integration of BC with 5G-enabled UAV. Then, we present a case study of implementing BC with UAVs to secure industrial applications.},

In this case, the customers (i.e., who are sharing the AV) and the AV all should come into the picture to verify each other. However, When a user requests for a ride share or rent, the responding AV/IoT device does not have the sufficient capability to store, process, or verify each other. In the existing security solutions, every AV/IoT device typically needs to rely on a trusted third party, which invokes another trust issue. If the trusted third party is rogue or loses credibility, the whole system will collapse. This research aims at exploiting Blockchain to provide a secure and reliable way to communicate among devices with trusts.

abstract = {Due to the rapid penetration of the Internet of Things (IoT) into human life, illegal access to IoT resources (e.g., data and actuators) has greatly threatened our safety. Access control, which specifies who (i.e., subjects) can access what resources (i.e., objects) under what conditions, has been recognized as an effective solution to address this issue. To cope with the distributed and trust-less nature of IoT systems, we propose a decentralized and trustworthy Capability-Based Access Control (CapBAC) scheme by using the Ethereum smart contract technology. In this scheme, a smart contract is created for each object to store and manage the capability tokens (i.e., data structures recording granted access rights) assigned to the related subjects, and also to verify the ownership and validity of the tokens for access control. Different from previous schemes which manage the tokens in units of subjects, i.e., one token per subject, our scheme manages the tokens in units of access rights or actions, i.e., one token per action. Such novel management achieves more fine-grained and flexible capability delegation and also ensures the consistency between the delegation information and the information stored in the tokens. We implemented the proposed CapBAC scheme in a locally constructed Ethereum blockchain network to demonstrate its feasibility. In addition, we measured the monetary cost of our scheme in terms of gas consumption to compare our scheme with the existing Blockchain-Enabled Decentralized Capability-Based Access Control (BlendCAC) scheme proposed by other researchers. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the BlendCAC scheme in terms of the flexibility, granularity, and consistency of capability delegation at almost the same monetary cost.},

abstract = {Generation from distributed renewable energy sources is constantly increasing. Due to its volatility, the integration of this non-controllable generation poses severe challenges to the current energy system. Thus, ensuring a reliable balance of energy generation and consumption becomes increasingly demanding. In our approach to tackle these challenges, we suggest that consumers and prosumers can trade self-produced energy in a peer-to-peer fashion on microgrid energy markets. Thus, consumers and prosumers can keep profits from energy trading within their community. This provides incentives for investments in renewable generation plants and for locally balancing supply and demand. Hence, both financial as well as socio-economic incentives for the integration and expansion of locally produced renewable energy are provided. The efficient operation of these microgrid energy markets requires innovative information systems for integrating the market participants in a user-friendly and comprehensive way. To this end, we present the concept of a blockchain-based microgrid energy market without the need for central intermediaries. We derive seven market components as a framework for building efficient microgrid energy markets. Then, we evaluate the Brooklyn Microgrid project as a case study of such a market according to the required components. We show that the Brooklyn Microgrid fully satisfies three and partially fulfills an additional three of the seven components. Furthermore, the case study demonstrates that blockchains are an eligible technology to operate decentralized microgrid energy markets. However, current regulation does not allow to run local peer-to-peer energy markets in most countries and, hence, the seventh component cannot be satisfied yet.},

@article{Hofman_2019,
abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to explore a paradoxical situation, asking whether it is possible to reconcile the immutable ledger known as blockchain with the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR), and more broadly privacy and data protection. Design/methodology/approach: This paper combines doctrinal legal research examining the GDPR's application and scope with case studies examining blockchain solutions from an archival theoretic perspective to answer several questions, including: What risks are blockchain solutions said to impose (or mitigate) for organizations dealing with data that is subject to the GDPR? What are the relationships between the GDPR principles and the principles of archival theory? How can these two sets of principles be aligned within a particular blockchain solution? How can archival principles be applied to blockchain solutions so that they support GDPR compliance? Findings: This work will offer an initial exploration of the strengths and weaknesses of blockchain solutions for GDPR compliant information governance. It will present the disjunctures between GDPR requirements and some current blockchain solution designs and implementations, as well as discussing how solutions may be designed and implemented to support compliance. Immutability of information recorded on a blockchain is a differentiating positive feature of blockchain technology from the perspective of trusted exchanges of value (e.g. cryptocurrencies) but potentially places organizations at risk of non-compliance with GDPR if personally identifiable information cannot be removed. This work will aid understanding of how blockchain solutions should be designed to ensure compliance with GDPR, which could have significant practical implications for organizations looking to leverage the strengths of blockchain technology to meet their needs and strategic goals. Research limitations/implications: Some aspects of the social layer of blockchain solutions, such as law and business procedures, are also well understood. Much less well understood is the data layer, and how it serves as an interface between the social and the technical in a sociotechnical system like blockchain. In addition to a need for more research about the data/records layer of blockchains and compliance, there is a need for more information governance professionals who can provide input on this layer, both to their organizations and other stakeholders. Practical implications: Managing personal data will continue to be one of the most challenging, fraught issues for information governance moving forward; given the fairly broad scope of the GDPR, many organizations, including those outside of the EU, will have to manage personal data in compliance with the GDPR. Blockchain technology could play an important role in ensuring organizations have easily auditable, tamper-resistant, tamper-evident records to meet broader organizational needs and to comply with the GDPR. Social implications: Because the GDPR professes to be technology-neutral, understanding its application to novel technologies such as blockchain provides an important window into the broader context of compliance in evolving information governance spaces. Originality/value: The specific question of how GDPR will apply to blockchain information governance solutions is almost entirely novel. It has significance to the design and implementation of blockchain solutions for recordkeeping. It also provides insight into how well “technology-neutral” laws and regulations actually work when confronted with novel technologies and applications. This research will build upon significant bodies of work in both law and archival science to further understand information governance and compliance as we are shifting into the new GDPR world.},

abstract = {Internet-of-Things (IoT) has made ubiquitous computing a reality by extending Internet connectivity in various applications deployed across the globe. IoT connect billions of objects together for high speed data transfer especially in 5G-enabled industrial environment during information collection and processing. Most of the issues such as access control mechanism, time to fetch the data from different devices and protocols used may not be applicable infor future applications as these protocols are based upon a centralized architecture. This centralized architecture may have a single point of failure alongwith the computational overhead. So, there is a need for an efficient decentralized access control mechanism for device-to-device (D2D) communication in various industrial sectors IoT-enabled industrial automation. In such an environment, security and privacy preservation are major concerns as most of the solutions are based upon the centralized architecture. To mitigate the aforementioned issues, in this paper, we present an in-depth survey of state-of-the-art proposals having 5G-enabled IoT as a backbone for blockchain-based industrial automation for the applications such as-Smart city, Smart Home, Healthcare 4.0, Smart Agriculture, Autonomous vehicles and Supply chain management. From the existing proposals, it has been observed that blockchain can revolutionize most of the current and future industrial applications in different sectors by providing a fine-grained decentralized access control. Various transactions and database logs can be traced efficiently using blockchain for consistency and preivacy preservation in the aforementiioned industrial sectors. The open issues and challenges of 5G-enabled IoT for blockchain-based Industrial automation are also analyzed in the text. Finally, a comparison of existing proposals with respect to various parameters is presented which allows the end users to select one of the proposals in comparison to its merits over the others.},

abstract = {With the emerging technology for distributed generation and urge of improving quality of service of power supply for energy users, more and more Microgrids (MGs) are integrated into the distributed networks to serve the energy users. These Microgrids are gradually formulating a Multi-Microgrid System (MMGS, Multi-Microgrid System), which will play an important role for the future energy supply. Building a centralized control center not only increases the expense of investment, but also brings the issues of maintaining fairness among energy users. To address these problems, this paper proposes a peer-to-peer method for energy trading of MMGS, based on the idea of decentralized trading. An auction-based trading mechanism suitable for peer-to-peer energy trading is proposed first. For this mechanism, the MGs firstly declare their energy buying bids or selling quotations. Then, the market-clearing price is determined by using a unified weight clearing algorithm in a decentralized manner. By applying the edge technology of Blockchain, the implementation of the proposed peer-to-peer energy trading method, including the architecture, procedures, security check, etc., is also discussed. The proposed Blockchain-based energy trading platform can realize the decentralized and autonomous energy trading of MGs within an MMGS. A case study with an MMGS with 10 MG units is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {In distributed environment, a digital transaction or operation requires transparency and trust among multiple stakeholders. Several approches address such issues however, among these blockchain provides a viable solution which has received wide acceptance in the recent past. Permissioned blockchain solutions adopt more efficient consensus algorithms and smart contracts. There are many smart-contract solutions exists (such as, etherium, IBM blockchain, hyperledger fabric), however, much of them mainly follow traditional access control models. A role-based access control model provides controlled access of resources to members. This research work presents an extended usage control model known as DistU (Distributed Usage Control). DistU is proposed to capture all possible access control models required by a business for permissioned blockchain frameworks. DistU can monitor a resource continuously during the operation and update the attributes accordingly, performing different actions, such as denying or revoking permissions. We believe that the proposed DistU usage control model can provide a fine-grained control for blockchain resource management. The paper also contributes to provide a protoype implementation of fine-grained permission model on Hyperledger Fabric. The reason of selecting Fabric for this research is that, it is the first execute-order achitecture blockchain that provides a platform to develop general business applciations. Secondly, it is an opensource operating system of permissioned blockchain with huge industry support.},

Taking benefits from local actors and prosumers, our proposal allows offering a better connectivity to end-users in a model involving network operators and a crowd of local actors. We show that building a multi-actors and densified access network infrastructure has become possible in a distributed way. Incumbent actors with a large footprint act as trusted partners securing the infrastructure and providing guarantees, while the crowd of local actors deploys multiple access points and are rewarded for their contribution. Rewarding is possible thanks to a distributed Bandwidth Identity ledger along with a Proof of Bandwidth (PoB) mechanism. This article presents the main principles of this new connectivity platform, BALAdIN (Bandwidth Ledger AccountIng Networks), which relies on a consortium blockchain with access control mechanisms removing communitarian Wifi and ad hoc networks drawbacks. Indeed, combining distributed ledgers and edge networks allows local actors to cooperate with trusted parties, which leverages the full potential of multi-actors access networks.},

abstract = {Usage-based Insurance (UBI) for vehicles determines the insurance premiums according to actual usage and driving pattern. It can significantly reduce insurance costs for safe drivers, however, UBI schemes require detailed driving data to determine the insurance premiums, which may lead to serious privacy breach for drivers. Moreover, most existing UBI schemes require a centralized insurance company as the intermediary to manage insurances. Such a centralized solution incurs too much monetary costs as well as time cost. In this paper, we propose PRIDE, a privacy-preserving and decentralized UBI scheme using the blockchain to record encrypted driving data, and the smart contract running on the blockchain to calculate insurance premiums. Different from existing UBI schemes, PRIDE achieves security and privacy without relying on any centralized party or any trusted/tamper-proof hardware. We have analyzed security of PRIDE and evaluated its performance. The results show that PRIDE is very efficient in processing UBI insurances-each insurance request can be processed in about 898ms.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a blockchain-based energy trading platform for electric vehicles in smart campus parking lots. Smart parking lots are smart places capable of supporting both parking and charging services for electric vehicles. The electric vehicle owner may want to charge energy at a low price and sell it during peak hours at a higher price. The proposed system architecture consists of two layers: the physical infrastructure layer and the cyber infrastructure layer. The physical infrastructure layer represents all of the physical components located in the campus distribution power system, such as electric vehicles charging stations, transformers, and electric feeders, while the cyber infrastructure layer supports the operation of the physical infrastructure layer and enables selling/buying energy among participants. Blockchain technology is a promising candidate to facilitate auditability and traceability of energy transactions among participants. A real case of a parking lot with a realistic parking pattern in a university campus is considered. The system consists of a university control center and various parking lot local controllers (PLLCs). The PLLC broadcasts the electricity demand and the grid price, and each electric vehicle owner decides whether to charge/discharge based on their benefits. The proposed system is implemented on Hyperledger Fabric. Participants, assets, transactions, and smart contracts are defined and discussed. Two scenarios are considered. The first scenario represents energy trading between electric vehicles as sellers and the PLLC as a buyer, while the second scenario involves energy trading between electric vehicles as buyers and the PLLC as a seller. The proposed platform provides profits for participants, as well as enables balancing for the university load demand locally.},

The currency is issued according to the amount participants contribute to the initiative, which is quantified based on operational metrics gathered from the infrastructure. Furthermore, the platform enables participants to deploy smart contracts which encode self-enforcing agreements about the infrastructure services they exchange. The architecture has been evaluated through a case study at The Things Network (TTN) a global distributed crowdsourced Internet of Things initiative. The case study revealed that the architecture is effective for the selected case at TTN.

In the era of the Internet of Everything, millions of devices and links in IoT pose more significant challenges to data management. Most existing solutions employ centralized systems to control IoT devices, which brings about the privacy and security issues in IoT data management. Recently, blockchain has attracted much attention in the field of IoT due to its decentralization, traceability, and non-tamperability. However, it is non-trivial to apply the current blockchain techniques to IoT due to the lack of scalability and high resource costs. Different blockchain platforms have their particular advantages in the scenario of IoT data management. In this paper, we propose a cross-chain framework to integrate multiple blockchains for efficient and secure IoT data management. Our solution builds an interactive decentralized access model which employs a consortium blockchain as the control station. Other blockchain platforms customized for specific IoT scenarios run as the backbone of all IoT devices. It is equivalent to opening the off-chain channels on the consortium blockchain. Our model merges transactions in these channels for confirmation based on the notary mechanism. Finally, we implement a prototype of the proposed model based on hyperledge Fabric and IOTA Tangle. We evaluate the performance of our method through extensive experiments. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our framework.},

However, current blockchain technologies are unable to meet the highly concurrent IoT data transactions and the fast expansion of IoT devices due to the decentralized architecture. Moreover, there is a lack of useful solutions for effective data sharing between public and private networks, and networks with different services (e.g., smart grid and intelligent transportation). In this paper, we propose a decentralized data access model for IoT data storage and sharing based on the FISCO-BCOS blockchain. In the model, we divide the IoT devices that handle different services into different set-chains. These set-chains share data with each other through an elaborate access control model. Experimental results show that the proposed model fits the characteristics of the IoT data management, guaranteeing the privacy and security requirements with better scalability.

This technology entered the market and is expected to grow in the upcoming years, as the critical questions related to the management and communication security continue to be challenging research problems. Current solutions of access control system management that enables communication between devices depend mainly on the use of digital certificates for authentication. However, such an approach imposes significant overhead on IoT devices since it is computationally demanding and requires validation of the certificate within a limited period. In addition, relying on a central node for deciding on issuing and revoking certificates introduces a single point of failure and could even risk the safety of personal information or physical damages related to IoT services. In this paper, we propose a new distributed authentication and access control system management for IoT by the use of Blockchain technology to keep track of the certificate of each IoT device (valid or revoked) in distributed and immutable records. In essence we replace certificate verification with a lightweight blockchain-based authentication approach. In addition, we propose a fully distributed IoT admission/revocation scheme. We show that our scheme could alleviate the computation overhead and enhance the response time while improving the overall system security.},

Currently, identity federation is the most useful solution to overcome the aforementioned issues and simplify the user experience by allowing efficient authentication mechanisms and use of identity information from data distributed across multiple domains. However, this approach creates considerable complexity in managing trust relationships for both the cloud service providers and their clients. Poor management of trust in federated identity management systems brings with it many security, privacy and interoperability issues, which contributes to the reluctance of organizations to move their critical identity data to the cloud.

abstract = {Security of payment (SOP) issues still persist in the construction industry despite numerous investigations and incremental reforms. Various solutions and policies have been proposed and analysed in-depth in previous studies. However, limited studies have focused on the integration of advanced technologies to address SOP issues. The aim of this research is to develop a comprehensive framework that integrates practical advanced technologies to address SOP issues in the construction industry. A concurrent mixed-method design was adopted to (a) identify the industry's perspective on what advanced technologies can be accepted to address SOP issues through a questionnaire survey, and (b) identify the use of advanced technologies through a live construction project as a case study. Subsequently, a data flow diagram framework was developed to articulate the whole process flow of how the system delivers automatic payments to subcontractors upon the completion of their contractual obligations and work done. This research contributes new and practical insights into the application and integration of smart sensors, oracles, BIM, blockchain technology and smart contracts in addressing SOP issues in the construction industry.},

Due to the different economic development levels of each country and the gaps among financial environment maturity, all countries have different strategies and regulations towards the privacy protection of data in financial scenes, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) by European Union (EU). A blockchain as a continuously growing list of records managed by a peer-to-peer network is widely used in various application scenarios, and can protect the privacy of financial data. However, financial blockchain still poses some problems that cannot fully meet the data protection needs. In order to address the existing problems, this paper proposes a new blockchain-based data privacy management framework. The framework consists of three components: a data privacy classification method according to the characteristics of financial data and a new collaborative-filtering-based model and a confirmation data disclosure scheme for customer strategies based on the Nudge Theory. We implement a prototype and propose a set of algorithms for this management framework.},

abstract = {With the emergence of distributed ledger technology (DLT), numerous practitioners and researchers have proclaimed its beneficial impact on supply chain transactions in the future. However, the vast majority of DLT initiatives are discontinued after a short period. With the full potential of DLT laying far down the road, especially managers in supply chain management (SCM) seek for short-term cost-saving effects of DLT in order to achieve long-term benefits of DLT in the future. However, the extant research has bypassed grounding long-term as well as short-term effects of DLT on supply chain transaction with empirical data. We address this shortcoming, following an abductive research approach and combining empirical data from a multiple case study design with the corresponding literature. Our study reveals that the effects of DLT on supply chain transactions are two-sided. We found six effects of DLT solutions that have a cost-reducing or cost avoidance impact on supply chain transactions. In addition, we found two effects that change the power distribution between buyers and suppliers in transactions and a single effect that reduces the dependency of supply chain transactions on third parties. While cost-reducing and avoidance as well as dependency-reducing effects are positive effects, the change in power distribution might come with disadvantages. With these findings, the paper provides the first empirical evidence of the impact of DLT on supply chain transactions, which will enable managers to improve their assessment of DLT usage in supply chains.},

The purpose of developing smart cities is to enhance quality of life factors for people dwelling within them. To achieve that purpose, technologies such as IoT and cloud computing have been utilized. Blockchain technology is also among the promising technologies that can offer countless valuable services to its end users. It is a immutable programmable digital register for the purpose of recording virtual assets having some value and was primarily developed for digital currencies like Bitcoin. To fully utilize the services of blockchain technology within smart cities, characteristics of blockchain technology, and its key requirements and research challenges need to be identified.

Furthermore, indispensable requirements for incorporating blockchain technology within smart cities are enumerated. A conceptual architecture for securing smart city using blockchain technology is proposed and explained using a possible use case study. An overview of a real-world three-blockchain- based smart city case study is also presented. Finally, several imperative research challenges are identified and discussed.},

abstract = {Migrating an application from local compute resources to commercial cloud resources involves giving up full control of the physical infrastructure, as the cloud service provider (CSP) is responsible for managing the physical infrastructure, including its security. The reliance of a tenant on a CSP can create a trust issue around whether the CSP is upholding its end of the bargain. CSPs acknowledge this and provide a guarantee through a Service Level Agreement (SLA). SLAs need to be verified for satisfaction of the defined objectives. To avoid raising the trust issue again, such a verification procedure needs to be unbiased and independently achievable by both tenants and CSPs without one relying on the other party. In this paper, we consider an SLA offered by the provider that guarantees the integrity of tenants' data, and propose to verify the SLA using an integrity checking method based on a distributed ledger. Our proposed method allows both CSPs and tenants to perform integrity checking without one party relying on the other. The method uses a blockchain as a distributed ledger to store evidence of data integrity. Assuming the ledger as a secure, trusted source of information, the evidence can be used to resolve conflicts between providers and tenants. In addition, we present a prototype implementation and an experimental evaluation to show the feasibility of our verification method and to measure the time overhead.},

abstract = {Decentralized Online Social Networks (DOSNs) have been proposed as an alternative solution to the current centralized Online Social Networks (OSNs). Online Social Networks are based on centralized architecture (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, or Google+), while DOSNs do not have a service provider that acts as central authority and users have more control over their information. Several DOSNs have been proposed during the last years. However, the decentralization of the OSN requires efficient solutions for protecting the privacy of users, and to evaluate the trust between users. Blockchain represents a disruptive technology which has been applied to several fields, among these also to Social Networks. In this paper, we propose a manageable, user-driven and auditable access control framework for DOSNs using blockchain technology. In the proposed approach, the blockchain is used as a support for the definition of privacy policies. The resource owner uses the public key of the subject to define flexible role-based access control policies, while the private key associated with the subjects Ethereum account is used to decrypt the private data once access permission is validated on the blockchain. We evaluate our solution by exploiting the Rinkeby Ethereum testnet to deploy the smart contract, and to evaluate its performance. Experimental results show the feasibility of the proposed scheme in achieving auditable and user-driven access control via smart contract deployed on the Blockchain.},

In order to solve this problem, secondary development is needed on the basis of the source system. For example, it is necessary to collect data from client applications or integrate their functions. Therefore, a framework of automatic encapsulation API based on the client system is proposed in this paper. Firstly, using a design pattern to reconstruct the runtime software architecture. Secondly, an algorithm is proposed for parameter matching to automatically construct API template. Thirdly, a framework is implemented to support design patterns and matching algorithms. In conclusion, we experimented with a real client system, and the results show that in most cases our method can effectively encapsulate and reduce the execution time of the functions.},

abstract = {Blockchain advantages, such as decentralised tamper-proof and smart contracts, are naturally suitable for the trading needs of energy internet, dealing with the problems of low efficiency, waste of resources, privacy leakage, etc. In this paper, an energy trading method is proposed based on blockchain expansion technology. The lightning network is used to expand the blockchain trading process, and divides the transaction into on-chain trading and off-chain trading; and the chain structure of the energy blockchain is expanded using a multi-chain architecture, and the blockchain is divided into an account blockchain and a transaction blockchain. A case study is carried out, in this research work, in combination with multiple energy trading scenarios in the energy local area network (LAN). The results show that the proposed method possesses a significant performance of improving the efficiency of energy trading and reducing the complexity of trading information.},

abstract = {Smart Cities depend on data from numerous different sources to live up to their full potential. Adding personal data from private sources to a smart city's resources significantly increases this potential. Sustainable utilisation of such data must base on legal compliancy, ethical soundness, and consent of the providing data subjects. They have to be assured that their personal data will not be used for anything beyond the scope they agreed to, and that it will not suffer from any additional risk exposure. For this we propose a solution for self-determined data subjects (SDDS), which keeps the private and personal data at their decentralized, safe locations, without depriving the smart city from the information contained within. SDDS achieves this with strict compartmentalization of its different system elements, by exclusively storing non-mnemonic indices and IDs in a public ledger, and by sending mere analytical results, yet no original data across the network. Such a setup ensures the data subjects' privacy, grants the smart city access to a high number of new data sources, and simultaneously handles the user-consent to ensure compliance with data protection laws.},

abstract = {Advances in the Internet of Things (IoT) computing paradigm have made it a popular solution covering many areas such as smart cities, connected vehicles, smart farming etc. to provide major economic benefits, reduced resource consumption, smarter environments and increased sharing of resources among other advantages. However, the security issues arising from the scale of connectivity and heterogeneity of resources in IoT make it a hot target for attackers, where centralized security solutions fall short. The vulnerabilities in providing proper device authentication and data integrity in IoT networks have been shown to introduce devastating effects. This calls for designing a data security architecture for IoT, which can accurately authenticate devices by anyone in the network in a decentralized manner and prevent unauthorized modification of the stored data. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based approach for IoT systems that introduces transparency and tamper-resistance into data storage and retrieval in IoT networks. Evaluation of a developed prototype demonstrates that the proposed solution is promising to present a unified framework for IoT data security.},

abstract = {Named Data Networking (NDN) is one of the strong competitors of the next generation network architecture, meeting the needs of today's users for the network. One problem with NDN is that the content requester does not know if there is any content in the network when it sends out the interest package, and it does not know where the target is. This problem is currently solved by the domain name resolution service, but the existing solution does not apply to the NDN architecture. Because the content in the NDN is identified by a human-readable name, the NDN architecture does not require an additional name resolution system. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based Content Name Search Mechanism (BCNSM) by binding the content producer and the human-readable content name as the unique identifier of the content, and then using the blockchain as a trusted organization to store content information, and dynamically stores the information through the smart contract, thereby mapping the content name and the storage location to each other. BCNSM provides users with content name search services and name to the content provider resolution services. Then the model was built for the BCNSM using the colored petri net, and the model process is verified by the model simulation to meet the expectations, and the state space analysis proves that the BCNSM has no deadlock. Finally, a prototype of the smart contract was implemented in Ethereum's testnet, and the storage and Gas overhead of content name registration and content cache address update were tested.},

To maintain the stability of data economic system, this paper proposes the Reliable IoT Data Economic System (RIDES) to provide IoT data a reliable, automatic, and intelligent trading environment. Applying the smart contract technique, IoT data in RIDES can be automatically traded without human intervention. As the trading procedure is performed based on blockchain, all transactions can be protected against tampering. Also, the RIDES provides the Smart Decision Making Module for users to develop practical pricing strategies. Thus, a seller can derive a price with the highest expected revenue for its data and a buyer can purchase its desired data referring to cost-performance ratio or data owner's trustworthiness. Even if malicious sellers cheat buyers, the latter can invoke trade dispute procedure to refund their payment, which makes the trading environment more reliable. As the blockchain-based operations usually cost much, the RIDES adopts the edge computing architecture to alleviate the burdens of IoT devices. Finally, the RIDES is implemented in IoT environments. The case study demonstrates that the transactions on IoT data can be performed correctly by RIDES.},

In this paper, we propose a decentralized digital rights management model of spatial data, which can provide a novel way of solving the existing copyright management problem or other problems in spatial data infrastructure for data sharing. An Ethereum smart contract is used in this model to realize spatial data digital rights management function. The InterPlanetary File System is utilized as external data storage for storing spatial data in the decentralized file system to avoid data destruction that is caused by a single point of failure. There is no central server in the model architecture, which has a completely decentralized nature and it makes spatial data rights management not dependent on third-party trust institutions. We designed three spatial data copyright management algorithms, developed a prototype system to implement and test the model, used the smart contract security verification tool to check code vulnerabilities, and, finally, discussed the usability, scalability, efficiency, performance, and security of the proposed model. The result indicates that the proposed model not only has diversified functions of copyright management compared with previous studies on the blockchain-based digital rights management, but it can also solve the existing problems in traditional spatial data infrastructure for data sharing due to its characteristics of complete decentralization, mass orientation, immediacy, and high security.},

abstract = {Blockchain is a recent technology whose importance is rapidly growing. One of its native features is pseudo-anonymity, since users are referred by (blockchain) addresses, which are hashed public keys with no link to real identities. However, when moving from the use of blockchain as simple platform for cryptocurrencies to applications in which we want to automatize trust and transparency, in general, there is not the need of anonymity. Indeed, there are situations in which secure accountability, trust and transparency should coexist (e.g., in supply-chain management) to accomplish the goal of the application to design. Blockchain may appear little suitable for these cases, due to its pseudo-anonymity feature, so that an important research problem is to understand how to overcome this drawback. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a solution that mixes the mechanism of public digital identity with blockchain via Identity-Based-Encryption. We define the solution and show its application to a real-life case study.},

Important adoption decisions, including when to deploy blockchain, how to plan the investment, how to transfer current businesses onto blockchain, and how to price the blockchain service depend on this risk analysis. Yet very little study exists concerning the blockchain adoption planning with risks analysis. This research presents a cost-and-risk analysis framework and an adoption planning method for the case of blockchain application in carbon trading.

The system leverages the advantages of blockchain technology and incorporates institutional risk control framework.

abstract = {Objective: Decentralized privacy-preserving predictive modeling enables multiple institutions to learn a more generalizable model on healthcare or genomic data by sharing the partially trained models instead of patientlevel data, while avoiding risks such as single point of control. State-of-the-art blockchain-based methods remove the "server" role but can be less accurate than models that rely on a server. Therefore, we aim at developing a general model sharing framework to preserve predictive correctness, mitigate the risks of a centralized architecture, and compute the models in a fair way. Materials and Methods: We propose a framework that includes both server and "client" roles to preserve correctness. We adopt a blockchain network to obtain the benefits of decentralization, by alternating the roles for each site to ensure computational fairness. Also, we developed GloreChain (Grid Binary LOgistic REgression on Permissioned BlockChain) as a concrete example, and compared it to a centralized algorithm on 3 healthcare or genomic datasets to evaluate predictive correctness, number of learning iterations and execution time. Results: GloreChain performs exactly the same as the centralized method in terms of correctness and number of iterations. It inherits the advantages of blockchain, at the cost of increased time to reach a consensus model. Discussion: Our framework is general or flexible and can also address intrinsic challenges of blockchain networks. Further investigations will focus on higherdimensional datasets, additional use cases, privacy-preserving quality concerns, and ethical, legal, and social implications. Conclusions: Our framework provides a promising potential for institutions to learn a predictive model based on healthcare or genomic data in a privacy-preserving and decentralized way.},

Moreover, the recent advancements in autonomous cars also encourage the enabling technologies to integrate and provide holistic applications. To this end, one key requirement for EVs is to have an efficient, secure, and scalable infrastructure and framework for charging, billing, and auditing. However, the current manual charging systems for EVs may not be applicable to the autonomous cars that demand new, automatic, secure, efficient, and scalable billing and auditing mechanism. Owing to the distributed systems such as blockchain technology, in this paper, we propose a new charging and billing mechanism for electric vehicles that charge their batteries in a charging-on-The-move fashion. To meet the requirements of billing in electric vehicles, we leverage distributed ledger technology (DLT), a distributed peer-To-peer technology for micro-Transactions. Our proof-of-concept implementation of the billing framework demonstrates the feasibility of such system in electric vehicles. It is also worth noting that the solution can easily be extended to the electric autonomous cars (EAVs).},

In modernized mortgage market, exchange would happen naturally, allowing users to benefit from a web of trust, where parties do not need to be in a direct relationship with each other to reap rewards from referrals that originate from multiple parties. Pseudonymity and honesty are properties that blockchains handle natively, and this is a candidate solution to the "transparency" problem in lending and borrowing, which acts as a trust inhibitor at scale for many interactions.},

abstract = {Logs are critical data, which can help us to troubleshoot and identify the person in charge of an unexpected accident. Log systems have been widely used for log storage. However, the traditional log system can't prevent the log from being tampered. Centralized servers are more vulnerable to be attacked. Those who have permission to operate records can easily tamper with logs. Blockchain is a disruptive technology in recent years, which has the advantages of decentralization, tamper-proof and traceability. Given its decentralization and tamper-proof properties, the paper proposed a blockchain-based framework for secure log storage. However, the cost of storing big files in the blockchain is very high. Thus, the paper utilized the InterPlanetary File System(IPFS) to store log files instead of a blockchain. Besides, the paper adopted Ethereum blockchain to store the hash of log files and a smart contract to create an index for log files. The solution is not only applicable to log but also other scenarios requiring secure data storage and efficient retrieval.},

abstract = {Congestion represents one of the major problems in constantly growing cities, and the expansion and modernization of the traffic system are a major priority to all government infrastructures. In effect, more efficient traffic represents a more efficient economy. Solving the issue of congestion by increasing the number of roads is not always the most cost-effective solution as it represents massive changes in city infrastructures that have been present for decades. Urban planning shapes the environment around us but fails to address specifically the future traffic clogging. Our research tackles the problem of traffic congestion by proposing a system for vehicle detection, identification, and count, allied with reinforcement learning for traffic congestion anticipation and prediction. The need for a real-time and efficient system led us to push the research and development onto an Edge Computing platform using IoT and secure transactions using Hyperledger Fabric blockchain. Blockchain intervenes as a security protocol in the proposed system. The native form of Internet of Things does not include security protocols which are important to a large scale implementation. Ensuring the security of transactions and permanent access control is the main reason why blockchain is rooted in our system architecture. Our project aims to reduce the traffic load on roads experiencing significant congestion, and improve overall city traffic system without costly investment into new communication infrastructures and city planning.},

Specifically, distributed healthcare records have brought ease to how hospitals and other different third parties access the sensitive medical health information of patients for various uses leading to generation of big data. Big data in healthcare is important as it can be used in the prediction of outcome of diseases, prevention of co-morbidities fatality and saving the cost of medical treatment. However, this has also made it easy for security breaches and privacy violations during the data collection process. In this paper, we propose a platform which uses the blockchain technology for privacy preservation during collection, management and distribution of EHR data.

abstract = {Remote sensing data sharing will be an important part of the development of remote sensing. Remote sensing data is of great value, but the government is still the largest buyer behind the massive remote sensing data, and the commercial value of remote sensing has not been well discovered. In the future, data sharing will be one of the most effective methods in order to stimulate the commercial development of remote sensing data. Open sharing of data not only drives innovation in technology and industry, but also breaks down data barriers between various sectors of the economy, and generates great economic value for the country. According to this idea, this paper puts forward the remote sensing data sharing model which can conform to the development under the general trend of remote sensing data sharing. Remote sensing data often involves a series of security issues that need attention, such as land, so it is special. The remote sensing data involved in this paper is limited to commercially available data with the purpose of promoting the commercial development of remote sensing. The remote sensing data sharing envisaged in this paper involves remote sensing data that is built on the basis of being screened, not endangering or disclosing national geographic security information, and such data processing will help make people's life more convenient. Remote sensing data sharing faces three major problems, one is the data is large, and the resulting storage and processing problems, the second is that the data owner loses the control of the data, ownership, and the third is the real-time of remote sensing data, requiring the time of data processing must be timely and fast. We put forward a blockchain-based remote sensing data sharing model, which has the characteristics of cannot be tampered with, decentralized, secure, credible and collective maintenance, which is suitable for solving the security problems of data sharing of remote sensing institutions. We introduce concept cloud to solve data storage problems, and uses edge computing to alleviate data processing problems. This paper introduces the components of the model and the implementation principle, categorizes the existing remote sensing institutions, and uses the consensus mechanism to achieve fast and secure data sharing.},

Indeed, blockchains are not suitable for huge data storage, but there are distributed data storage solutions that can be used in a decentralized blockchain application. Regarding ergonomics, the use of blockchain technology should be in the background and transparent for users that may not know how to set up and secure a blockchain-based application.We propose an architecture aiming to easily link existing decentralized technologies and blockchains.

The data stored both at a centralized health-care level and at a local, patient level (e.g., on a smartphone) will be core elements when deciding treatment strategies in a health-care scenario with Internet of things–based elements. The current way of manufacturing pharmaceutical products and related existing logistic solutions is not ready for such a revolution. One of the key challenges is cybersecurity and related robust public key infrastructure solution. This work introduces one element of a potential solution at a prototype level: the concept of cryptopharmaceuticals where pharmaceutical products are connected in a patient-specific blockchain of individual dosage units. This technology is based on the concept where each produced dosage unit has a unique information-rich pattern. A proof-of-concept smartphone application was applied to demonstrate the visualization of this blockchain at different levels. This includes the manufacturing of the individualized dosage unit, the patient view for his/her personal blockchain, and integration of these products into a health Internet of things system. This unbreakable blockchain of personal medication history will provide means to avoid counterfeit products and to enable innovative logistic solutions.},

abstract = {As a core technology to manage decentralized systems, blockchain is gaining much popularity to deploy such applications as smart grid and healthcare systems. However, its utilization in resource-constrained mobile devices is limited due to high demands of resources and poor scalability with frequent-intensive transactions. Edge computing can be integrated to facilitate mobile devices in offloading their mining tasks to cloud resources. This integration ensures reliable access, distributed computation and untampered storage for scalable and secure transactions. It is imperative therefore that crucial issues of security, scalability and resources management be addressed to achieve successful integration. Studies have been conducted to explore suitable architectural requirements, and some researchers have applied the integration to deploy some specific applications. Despite these efforts, however, issues of anonymity, adaptability and integrity still need to be investigated further to attain a practical, secure decentralized data storage. We based our study on peer-to-peer and blockchain to achieve an Internet of Things (IoT) design supported by edge computing to acquire security and scalability levels needed for the integration. We investigated existing blockchain and associated technologies to discover solutions that address anonymity, integrity and adaptability issues for successful integration of blockchain in IoT systems. The discovered solutions were then incorporated in our conceptual design of the decentralized application prototype presented for secure storage of IoT data and transactions.},

abstract = {Purpose: Blockchain holds promise as a potential solution to the problem of cybersecurity in financial transactions. However, difficulty exists for both the industry and organizations in assessing this potential solution. Hence, it is important to understand how organizations in the financial sector can address these concerns by exploring blockchain implementation for financial transactions in the context of cybersecurity. To do this, the problem question is threefold: first, what objectives are important based on the strategic values of an organization for evaluating cybersecurity to improve the security of financial transactions? Second, how can they be used to ensure the cybersecurity of financial transactions in a financial organization? Third, how can these objectives be used to evaluate blockchain as a potential solution for enhancing the cybersecurity of organizations in the financial sector relative to existing cybersecurity methods? The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach: To accomplish this goal we utilize Keeney's (1992) multi-objective decision analytics technique, termed value-focused thinking (VFT), to demonstrate how organizations can assess a blockchain solution's value to maximize value-add within financial organization. Findings: The presented model clearly demonstrates the viability of using Keeney's (1992) VFT technique as a multi-criteria decision analysis tool for assessing blockchain technology. Further, a clear explanation of how this model can be extended and adapted for individual organizational use is provided. Originality/value: This paper engages both the academic literature as well as an expert panel to develop an assessment model for blockchain technology related to financial transactions by providing a useful method for structuring the decision-making process of organizations around blockchain technology.},

abstract = {Governments across the world are testing different uses of the blockchain for the delivery of their public services. Blockchain hashing-or the insertion of data in the blockchain (anchoring)-is one of the potential applications of the blockchain in this space. With this method, users can apply special scripts to add their data to blockchain transactions, ensuring both immutability and publicity. Blockchain hashing also secures the integrity of the original data stored on central governmental databases. The objective of this paper is to analyse the use of data hashing (anchoring) on the blockchain for public state-owned registries. This paper starts by analysing possible scenarios of hashing on the blockchain and assesses in which cases it may work and in which it is less likely to add value to a public administration. Second, the paper also compares this method with traditional digital signatures using PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) and discusses standardisation in each domain. Third, it also addresses issues related with concepts such as “distributed ledger technology” and “permissioned blockchains.” Finally, it raises the question of whether blockchain hashing is an effective solution for electronic governance, and concludes that its value is controversial, even if it is improved by PKI and other security measures. In this regard, we claim that governments need to identify pain points in governance in the first place, and then consider the trade-offs of the blockchain as a potential solution versus other alternatives.},

In a blockchain, individual systems can independently make decisions on joint information transactions. The decision-making procedures needed for this are executed based on fault-tolerant communication and voting and consensus procedures, while the results of these decision-making procedures are stored in distributed ledgers. Due to the intercommunication, interaction, and independent decision making by autonomous systems, the new whole of a blockchain is a complex entity.

In this paper, we associate resources allocation problem with trust value of vehicles for the first time. The trust value of vehicles can be obtained through trust management system. Considering that there are many defects in the state-in-art trust management schemes, in this paper, a decentralized trust management architecture is designed which constitutes of three layers based on consortium blockchain. A joint proof-of-stake and modified practical Byzantine fault tolerance (PoS-mPBFT) algorithm is proposed to the shorten the confirmation time, which is deployed on RSUs. Different from previous researches that focus on designing methods to evaluate trust value, we use prediction model to estimate trust value of vehicles in the next period. After calculating trust value of vehicles, it assigns more resources to those high credibility vehicles when SDN services are provided. Meanwhile, to increase the efficiency of resource allocation, we convert the multiple-path mapping problem of the virtual network into the multi-commodity flow problem, which is solved by a heuristic algorithm. The simulation results indicate that the proposed trust management architecture and heuristic algorithm could provide better safety in SDVN and shorten consensus time, meanwhile effectively abstract underlying resources to enhance network load balance and capacity.},

abstract = {In collaborative environments, where enterprises interact each other's without a centralised authority that ensures trust among them, the ability of providing cross-organisational services must be enabled also between mutually untrusting participants. Blockchain platforms and smart contracts have been proposed to implement collaborative processes. However, current solutions are platform-dependent and deploy on-chain the whole process, thus increasing the execution costs of smart contracts if deployed on permissionless blockchain. In this paper, we propose an approach that includes criteria to identify trust-demanding objects and activities in collaborative processes, a model to describe smart contracts in a platform-independent way and guidelines to deploy them in a blockchain. To this aim, a three-layered model is used to describe: (i) the collaborative process, represented in BPMN, where the business expert is supported to add annotations that identify trust-demanding objects and activities; (ii) Abstract Smart Contracts based on trust-demanding objects and activities only and specified by means of descriptors, that are independent from any blockchain technology; (iii) Concrete Smart Contracts, that implement abstract ones and are deployed over a specific blockchain, enabling the creation of a repository where a single descriptor is associated with multiple implementations. The flexibility and reduced costs of the approach, due to the smart contracts abstraction and the use of blockchain only when necessary, are discussed with a case study on remote monitoring services in the digital factory.},

However, the adoption of cloud federations is hindered by member organizations' concerns on sharing their data with potentially competing organizations. For cloud federations to be viable, federated organizations' privacy concerns should be alleviated by providing mechanisms that allow organizations to control which users from other federated organizations can access which data. We propose the architecture of a novel identity and access management system part of FaaS, a cloud federation service developed by the H2020 SUNFISH project.

Users are granted access to federated data when their identity attributes match the policies, but without revealing their attributes in clear. The architecture relies on two novel technologies, blockchain and Intel SGX hardware platform to guarantee integrity of the policy evaluation process.},

abstract = {Bitcoin is the first implementation of a technology that has become known as a ‘public permissionless' blockchain. Such systems allow public read/write access to an append-only blockchain database without the need for any mediating central authority. Instead, they guarantee access, security and protocol conformity through an elegant combination of cryptographic assurances and game theoretic economic incentives. Not until the advent of the Bitcoin blockchain has such a trusted, transparent, comprehensive and granular dataset of digital economic behaviours been available for public network analysis. In this article, by translating the cumbersome binary data structure of the Bitcoin blockchain into a high fidelity graph model, we demonstrate through various analyses the often overlooked social and econometric benefits of employing such a novel open data architecture. Specifically, we show: (i) how repeated patterns of transaction behaviours can be revealed to link user activity across the blockchain; (ii) how newly mined bitcoin can be associated to demonstrate individual accumulations of wealth; (iii) through application of the na{\"{i}}ve quantity theory of money that Bitcoin's disinflationary properties can be revealed and measured; and (iv) how the user community can develop coordinated defences against repeated denial of service attacks on the network. Such public analyses of this open data are exemplary benefits unavailable to the closed data models of the ‘private permissioned' distributed ledger architectures currently dominating enterprise-level blockchain development owing to existing issues of scalability, confidentiality and governance.},

Its requirements include data confidentiality, authentication, access control as well as privacy and trust among things and services. To evaluate entities trustworthiness, exchanging trust information is crucial to reach an accurate assessment. Secure sharing and storage of trust information is essential for its confidentiality, integrity and privacy. In this context, our objective is to propose a secure trust management system based on the blockchain technology so that we can take advantages of security features it provides regarding reliability, traceability and information integrity. Blockchain based trust management can provide tamper proof data, enable a more reliable trust information integrity verification, and help to enhance its privacy and availability during sharing and storage. For this purpose, we design and implement a blockchain based trust architecture to collect trust evidences, to define a trust score for each device and to securely store and share them with other devices within the network by embedding them into blockchain transactions. Results from performance evaluation demonstrate that our proposal provides security features including tamper-proof and attacks resiliency, reliability in addition to a low complexity for IoT scenarios and applications.},

abstract = {The adoption of machine learning and deep learning is on the rise in the cybersecurity domain where these AI methods help strengthen traditional system monitoring and threat detection solutions. However, adversaries too are becoming more effective in concealing malicious behavior amongst large amounts of benign behavior data. To address the increasing time-to-detection of these stealthy attacks, interconnected and federated learning systems can improve the detection of malicious behavior by joining forces and pooling together monitoring data. The major challenge that we address in this work is that in a federated learning setup, an adversary has many more opportunities to poison one of the local machine learning models with malicious training samples, thereby influencing the outcome of the federated learning and evading detection. We present a solution where contributing parties in federated learning can be held accountable and have their model updates audited. We describe a permissioned blockchain-based federated learning method where incremental updates to an anomaly detection machine learning model are chained together on the distributed ledger. By integrating federated learning with blockchain technology, our solution supports the auditing of machine learning models without the necessity to centralize the training data. Experiments with a realistic intrusion detection use case and an autoencoder for anomaly detection illustrate that the increased complexity caused by blockchain technology has a limited performance impact on the federated learning, varying between 5 and 15%, while providing full transparency over the distributed training process of the neural network. Furthermore, our blockchain-based federated learning solution can be generalized and applied to more sophisticated neural network architectures and other use cases.},

Gas, paid in Ethers (i.e., the cryptocurrency in Ethereum), is required for the costs to upload and run smart contracts on Ethereum. As cost-inefficiently designed smart contracts result in unnecessary costs, it is vital to eliminate any gas-wasteful code fragments to optimize the deployment costs. In this study, we define five gas-wasteful patterns: ‘Over-public variables', ‘Redundant initial values', ‘Loose packing', ‘Non-base unit types', and ‘Non-constant variables', based on the state variables in Solidity, the most commonly used implementation language for smart contracts in Ethereum. We also propose improvement methods related to these patterns and a solution to identify and eliminate the patterns. Furthermore, we analyze 143 real-world contracts deployed on Ethereum and find that 56% of them include the above-mentioned patterns. We also upgrade 43 of the pattern-matched contracts and demonstrate that their deployment costs are decreased on an average by 13.47%, and the most-reduced rate is 64%.},

abstract = {Recently, oblivious random access machine (ORAM) has been widely used to prevent privacy leakage from user's access pattern. However, in multi-user scenarios, the obliviousness property of ORAM facilitates the malicious data modification by unauthorized users, which brings a new security challenge of user accountability to ORAM applications. Moreover, based on our observations, existing user accountability schemes for multi-user ORAM induce the extremely unacceptable overhead in both time and storage. What is worse, it is still inherent the traditional cloud accountability problem that the untrusted cloud server may have misbehavior on storing the outsourced data. In this paper, we focus on the issue that how to do accountability for both malicious users and untrusted cloud server without the independent trusted third party server. To address the above problem, we design and implement a Traceable Oblivious RAM, or T-ORAM for short, a cryptographic system that protects the privacy of users and the integrity of outsourced data based on group signatures. It can detect malicious users quickly by utilizing the traceability property of group signatures, and cost less storage overhead comparing with the existing solutions. Then, we further propose a more secure solution of Blockchain-based Traceable Oblivious RAM (BT-ORAM). Specifically, by introducing the blockchain technology, BT-ORAM can detect the malicious behavior from both malicious users and untrusted cloud server. BT-ORAM is the first accountability work for multi-user ORAM that deal with both malicious users and the untrusted cloud server. Finally, security analysis and experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art accountability work for oblivious RAM, S-GORAM, in both security and performance.},

Various systems, like the Web PKI (X.509) and PGP's Web of Trust are used to manage trust in this setting. In recent years, blockchain technology has been introduced as a panacea to our security problems, including that of authentication, without sufficient reasoning, as to its merits.In this work, we investigate the merits of using open distributed ledgers (ODLs), such as the one implemented by blockchain technology, for securing TM systems for authentication. We formally model such systems, and explore how blockchain can help mitigate attacks against them. After formal argumentation, we conclude that in the context of Trust Management for authentication, blockchain technology, and ODLs in general, can offer considerable advantages compared to previous approaches. Our analysis is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to formally model and argue about the security of TM systems for authentication, based on blockchain technology. To achieve this result, we first provide an abstract model for TM systems for authentication. Then, we show how this model can be conceptually encoded in a blockchain, by expressing it as a series of state transitions. As a next step, we examine five prevalent attacks on TM systems, and provide evidence that blockchain-based solutions can be beneficial to the security of such systems, by mitigating, or completely negating such attacks.},

However, it is still not preferable for dealing with massive data produced by IoT because of its drawbacks such as delay, network overhead, and scalability issues. Therefore, in this paper we define some factors that should be considered when designing scalable models, and we propose a fully distributed trust management model for IoT that provide a large-scale trust model and address the limitations of Blockchain.

@article{de_la_Vega_2018,
abstract = {Modern IoT deployments do require considerable investments that might only be justified if the data being gathered could be monetized, which leads to the need for a digital data marketplace. In many cases, the provider of the IoT data needs to process it locally for data curation, aggregation, stream processing, etc. At the same time, the consumer could be interested in nearby data. This scenario resembles a fog computing architecture where companies require being able, keeping data under their control, to securely make it available to other companies in a peer-to-peer fashion, without needing a cloud intermediary (like traditional marketplaces do), thus maximizing the locality of the processing and avoiding the existence of a bottleneck when the intermediary makes the data delivery for accounting purposes. Nevertheless, this imposes a hard requirement: by not having a central marketplace, the peers (seller and customer) need to trust each other, which, in turn, requires enforcing a nonrepudiation schema. In this paper, the authors propose a distributed peer-to-peer architecture for such a data marketplace that takes advantage of the architectural fundamentals of fog computing, in which data processing, filtering, and stream based event generation is done in a fog node along with the data, and where relationships, both commercial agreements and data delivery, are performed directly between producers and consumers without the need of mutual trust thanks to the usage of blockchain principles (e.g., distributed ledger, consensus mechanism). The proposed architecture is validated through a case study involving a set of key issues regarding nonrepudiation commonly identified when moving from a centralized marketplace to a distributed one. Moreover, it is shown that the proposed solution does not bring in any limitation with regard to a centralized marketplace solution, in terms of pricing models (subscriptions, pay-per-use, etc.) or usage conditions (contract duration, updates rate, etc.).},

abstract = {Counterfeiting constitutes a major challenge in current supply chains leading to millions of dollars of lost revenue for the involved parties every year. Hardware-based authentication solutions built upon Physically Unclonable Functions (PUF) and RFID tags prevent counterfeiting in a multiparty supply chain context. Unfortunately, these solutions cannot prevent counterfeiting and duplication attacks by supply chain parties themselves, as they can simply equivocate by duplicating products in their local and unique activity ledger. In this work, we study the benefits and challenges of using distributed ledger technology (or blockchain) to prevent counterfeiting even in the presence of malicious supply chain parties. In particular, we show that the provision of a distributed and append-only ledger jointly governed by supply chain parties themselves, by means of a distributed consensus algorithm, makes permissioned blockchains such as Hyperledger Fabric a promising approach towards mitigating counterfeiting. At the same time, the distributed nature of the ledger also possesses a privacy challenge as competing supply chain parties strive to protect their businesses from the prying eyes of competitors. Additionally, we show our efforts to build a blockchain-based counterfeiting prevention system for automotive supply chains, albeit the lessons learned are seamlessly applied to other supply chains. From our experience, we highlight two lessons: (i) the requirement of adding identities other than supply chain entities themselves to facilitate the tracking of goods; and (ii) the challenges derived from privacy enforcement in such a permissioned scenario. We thus finalize this work with a set of challenges that need to be overcome to achieve the best of both worlds: a solution to the counterfeiting problem using distributed ledger technology while providing the privacy notions of interest for supply chain parties.},

abstract = {Recent interest in blockchain technology has spurred on a host of new applications in a variety of domains including spatio-temporal data management. The reliability and immutability of blockchain in addition to the decentralized trustless data processing offers promising solutions for modern enterprise systems. However, current blockchain proposals do not support spatio-temporal data processing. Further, a block-based sequential access data structure in the blockchain restricts efficient query processing. Therefore, a blockchain system is desirable that not only supports spatio-temporal data management but also provides efficient query processing. In this work, we propose efficient query processing for spatio-temporal blockchain data. We consider a spatio-temporal blockchain that records both time and location attributes for the transactions. The data storage and integrity is maintained by the introduction of a cryptographically signed tree data structure, a variant of Merkle KD-tree, which also supports fast spatial queries. For the temporal attribute, we consider Bitcoin like near uniform block generation and process temporal queries by a block-DAG data structure without the introduction of temporal indexes. For current position verification, we use Merkle-Patricia-Trie. We also propose a random graph model to generate a block-DAG topology for an abstract peer-to-peer network. A comprehensive evaluation demonstrates the applicability and the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, cloud computing, and big data, Medical Cyber Physical Systems (MCPS) are increasingly demanding data security, while cloud storage solves the storage problem of complex medical data. However, it is difficult to realize data security sharing. The decentralization feature of blockchain is helpful to solve the problem that the secure authentication process is highly dependent on the trusted third party and implement data security transmission. In this paper, the blockchain technology is used to describe the security requirements in authentication process, and a network model of MCPS based on blockchain is proposed. Through analysis of medical data storage architecture, it can ensure that data can't be tampered and untrackable. In the security authentication phase, bilinear mapping and intractable problems can be used to solve the security threat in the authentication process of medical data providers and users. It can avoid the credibility problem of the trusted third party, and also can realize the ?thyc=10?>two-way authentication between the hospital and blockchain node. Then, BAN logic is used to analyze security protocols, and formal analysis and comparison of security protocols are also made. The results show that the MCPS based on blockchain not only realizes medical treatment data sharing, but also meet the various security requirements in the security authentication phase. In addition, the storage and computing overhead costs is ideal. Therefore, the proposed scheme is more suitable for secure sharing of medical big data.},

abstract = {In this paper, a blockchain-based secure data sharing mechanism is proposed for Vehicular Networks (VNs). Edge service providers are introduced along with ordinary nodes to efficiently manage service provisioning. The edge service providers are placed in the neighborhood of the ordinary nodes to ensure smooth communication between them. The huge amount of data generated by smart vehicles is stored in a distributed file storage system, known as Interplanetary File System (IPFS). It is used to tackle the issues related to data storage in centralized architectures, such as data tampering, lack of privacy, vulnerability to hackers, etc. Monetary incentives are given to edge vehicle nodes to motivate them for accurate and timely service provisioning to ordinary nodes. In response, ordinary nodes give reviews to the edge nodes against the services provided by them, which are further stored in a blockchain to ensure integrity, security and transparency. Smart contracts are used to automate the system processes without the inclusion of an intermediate party and to check the reviews given to the edge nodes. To optimize gas consumption and to enhance the system performance, a Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus mechanism is used to validate the transactions. Moreover, a caching system is introduced at the edge nodes to store frequently used services. Furthermore, both security and privacy are enhanced in the proposed system by incorporating a symmetric key cryptographic mechanism. A trust management mechanism is also proposed in this work to calculate the nodes' reputation values based upon their trust values. These values determine the authenticity of the nodes involved in the network. Eventually, it is concluded from the simulation results that the proposed system is efficient for VNs.},

Second, secure messaging applications ranging from Signal to WhatsApp may deliver the content in an encrypted form, but they do not protect the metadata of the message and they rely on centralized servers.the EC Project NEXTLEAP is focussed on fixing these two problems by decentralizing traditional identities onto a privacy-enhanced based blockchain that can then be used to build access control lists in a decentralized manner, similar to SDSI. Furthermore, we improve on secure messaging by then using this notion of decentralized identity to build in group messaging, allowing messaging between different servers. NEXTLEAP is also working with the PANORAMIX EC project to use a generic mix networking infrastructure to hide the metadata of the messages themselves and plans to add privacy-enhanced data analytics that work in a decentralized manner.},

We first discuss opportunities and challenges in the integration of blockchain and biometrics, with emphasis in biometric template storage and protection, a key problem in biometrics still largely unsolved. Blockchain technologies provide excellent architectures and practical tools for securing and managing the sensitive and private data stored in biometric templates, but at a cost. We explore experimentally the key tradeoffs involved in that integration, namely: latency, processing time, economic cost, and biometric performance. We experimentally study those factors by implementing a smart contract on Ethereum for biometric template storage, whose cost-performance is evaluated by varying the complexity of state-of-the-art schemes for face and handwriting signature biometrics. We report our experiments using popular benchmarks in biometrics research, including deep learning approaches and databases captured in the wild. As a result, we experimentally show that straightforward schemes for data storage in blockchain (i.e., direct and hash-based) may be prohibitive for biometric template storage using state-of-the-art biometric methods. A good cost-performance tradeoff is shown by using a blockchain approach based on Merkle trees.},

abstract = {Big data ecosystems are increasingly important for the daily activities of any type of company. They are decisive elements in the organization, so any malfunction of this environment can have a great impact on the normal functioning of the company; security is therefore a crucial aspect of this type of ecosystem. When approaching security in big data as an issue, it must be considered not only during the creation and implementation of the big data ecosystem, but also throughout its entire lifecycle, including operation, and especially when managing and responding to incidents that occur. To this end, this paper proposes an incident response process supported by a private blockchain network that allows the recording of the different events and incidents that occur in the big data ecosystem. The use of blockchain enables the security of the stored data to be improved, increasing its immutability and traceability. In addition, the stored records can help manage incidents and anticipate them, thereby minimizing the costs of investigating their causes; that facilitates forensic readiness. This proposal integrates with previous research work, seeking to improve the security of big data by creating a process of secure analysis, design, and implementation, supported by a security reference architecture that serves as a guide in defining the different elements of this type of ecosystem. Moreover, this paper presents a case study in which the proposal is being implemented by using big data and blockchain technologies, such as Apache Spark or Hyperledger Fabric.},

As one of the network-enabled technologies, cloud computing has been broadly adopted in the industry through numerous cloud service models. Fusing blockchain technology with existing cloud systems has a great potential in both functionality/ performance enhancement and security/ privacy improvement. The question remains on how blockchain technology inserts into current deployed cloud solutions and enables the reengineering of cloud datacenter. This survey addresses this issue and investigates recent efforts in the technical fusion of blockchain and clouds. Three technical dimensions roughly are covered in this work. First, we concern the service model and review an emerging cloud-relevant blockchain service model, Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS); second, security is considered a key technical dimension in this work and both access control and searchable encryption schemes are assessed; finally, we examine the performance of cloud datacenter with supports/ participance of blockchain from hardware and software perspectives. Main findings of this survey will be theoretical supports for future reference of blockchain-enabled reengineering of cloud datacenter.},

abstract = {Organizations nowadays are largely computerized, with a mixture of internal and external services providing them with on-demand functionality. In some situations (e.g. emergency situations), cross-organizational collaboration is needed, providing external users access to internal services. Trust between partners in such a collaboration can however be an issue. Although (federated) access control policies may be in place, it is unclear which data was requested and delivered after a collaboration has finished. This may lead to disputes between participating organizations. The open-source permissioned blockchain Hyperledger Fabric is utilized to create a logging mechanism for the actions performed by the participants in such a collaboration. This paper presents the architecture needed for such a logging mechanism and provides details on its operation. A prototype was designed in order to evaluate the performance of an asynchronous logging approach. Measurements show that the proposed logging mechanism enables organizations to create a log of service interactions with limited delay imposed on the data exchange process.},

But an IoT network is vulnerable to many privacy and security concerns. While some researchers have tried to define different access control models for IoT and tried to use blockchain in some cases, the solutions presented to date lacks a flexible and robust access control model that can be used for complex organization and cross-organization resource access scenarios and lacks the scalability and performance needed for IoT. This paper introduces a novel entitlement-based access control model that provides an efficient and secure way to delegate resource access rights to any entity. The solution uses service-oriented approach and a combination of public blockchain (with smart contracts) and local off-chain data for entitlements management and control. To analyze the proposed architecture, a large-scale cross-organization IoT scenario is taken into consideration and some qualitative evaluations are presented while implementation with Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts are currently in progress.},

abstract = {Recent advancements in information and communication technology is enabling a significant revolution in e-Health research and industry. In the case of personal medical data sharing, data security and convenience are crucial requirements to the interaction and collaboration of electronic medical record (EMR) systems. However, it's hard for current systems to meet these requirements as they have inconsistent structures in terms of security policies and access control models. A new solution direction is essential to enhance data-accessing while regulating it with government mandates in privacy and security to ensure the accountability of the medical usage data. Blockchain seems to pave the way for revolution in the conventional healthcare industry benefiting by its unique features such as data privacy and transparency. In this paper, a blockchain-based medical platform using a smart contract is proposed to secure the EMR management. This approach provides patients a comprehensive, immutable log and easy access to their medical information across different departments within the hospital. A case study for hospital is built on a permissioned network, and a series of experimental tests are performed to demonstrate the usability and efficiency of the designed platform. Lastly, a benchmark study by leveraging various performance metrics is made and the outcomes indicate that the designed platform surpasses the ability of existing works in various aspects. The results of this work reveal that the proposed solution has the great potential to accelerate the development of a decentralized digital healthcare ecosystem.},

abstract = {The majority of business activity of our integrated and connected world takes place in networks based on cloud computing infrastructure that cross national, geographic and jurisdictional boundaries. Such an efficient entity interconnection is made possible through an emerging networking paradigm, Software Defined Networking (SDN) that intends to vastly simplify policy enforcement and network reconfiguration in a dynamic manner. However, despite the obvious advantages this novel networking paradigm introduces, its increased attack surface compared to traditional networking deployments proved to be a thorny issue that creates skepticism when safety-critical applications are considered. Especially when SDN is used to support Internet-of-Things (IoT)-related networking elements, additional security concerns rise, due to the elevated vulnerability of such deployments to specific types of attacks and the necessity of inter-cloud communication any IoT application would require. The overall number of connected nodes makes the efficient monitoring of all entities a real challenge, that must be tackled to prevent system degradation and service outage. This position paper provides an overview of common security issues of SDN when linked to IoT clouds, describes the design principals of the recently introduced Blockchain paradigm and advocates the reasons that render Blockchain as a significant security factor for solutions where SDN and IoT are involved.},

This advanced model enables healthcare services with low operational cost, high flexibility, and EHRs availability. However, this new paradigm also raises concerns about data privacy and network security for e-health systems. How to reliably share EHRs among mobile users while guaranteeing high-security levels in the mobile cloud is a challenging issue. In this paper, we propose a novel EHRs sharing framework that combines blockchain and the decentralized interplanetary file system (IPFS) on a mobile cloud platform. Particularly, we design a trustworthy access control mechanism using smart contracts to achieve secure EHRs sharing among different patients and medical providers. We present a prototype implementation using Ethereum blockchain in a real data sharing scenario on a mobile app with Amazon cloud computing. The empirical results show that our proposal provides an effective solution for reliable data exchanges on mobile clouds while preserving sensitive health information against potential threats. The system evaluation and security analysis also demonstrate the performance improvements in lightweight access control design, minimum network latency with high security and data privacy levels, compared to the existing data sharing models.},

The use of blockchain technology poses multiple challenges as the software is operated in a decentralized, trustless, transparent and tamper-proof environment. When building decentralized apps the developers need to deal with blockchain properties such as decentralization, a certain delay in the execution of function calls of distributed code contracts and particularly need to consider how users interact with their application. We surveyed several existing decentralized apps and examined their architecture to identify multiple reoccurring architectural patterns, each with different implications regarding the trust, user experience and security. As building blockchain-oriented applications is gaining importance, models, tools and methods for blockchain-oriented software engineering have to be developed. This paper gives a first hint towards architectural patterns for blockchain-based applications and motivates why it is important to consider how the user interacts with the decentralized apps.},

Within the architecture, a blockchain-based controller manages identity and access control policies and serves as a tamper-proof log of access events. In addition, off-chain edge nodes store the EHR data and apply policies specified in Abbreviated Language For Authorization (ALFA) to enforce attribute-based access control on EHR data in collaboration with the blockchain-based access control logs. We evaluate the proposed hybrid architecture by utilizing Hyperledger Composer Fabric blockchain to measure the performance of executing smart contracts and ACL policies in terms of transaction processing time and response time against unauthorized data retrieval.},

abstract = {In order to ensure the information security, most of the important information including the data of advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) in the energy internet is currently transmitted and exchanged through the intranet or the carrier communication. The former increases the cost of network construction, and the latter is susceptible to interference and attacks in the process of information dissemination. The blockchain is an emerging decentralized architecture and distributed computing paradigm. Under the premise that these nodes do not need mutual trust, the blockchain can implement trusted peer-to-peer communication for protecting the important information by adopting distributed consensus mechanisms, encryption algorithms, point-to-point transmission and smart contracts. In response to the above issues, this paper firstly analyzes the information security problems existing in the energy internet from the four perspectives of system control layer, device access, market transaction and user privacy. Then blockchain technology is introduced, and its working principles and technical characteristics are analyzed. Based on the technical characteristics, we propose the multilevel and multichain information transmission model for the weak centralization of scheduling and the decentralization of transaction. Furthermore, we discuss that the information transmission model helps solve some of the information security issues from the four perspectives of system control, device access, market transaction and user privacy. Application examples are used to illustrate the technical features that benefited from the blockchain for the information security of the energy internet.},

This paper explores the rationale for the pursuit of alternative network architectures to facilitate the transition towards high penetration levels of renewable energies. Furthermore, the emerging research field of transactive energy markets and their potential for energy price reductions is presented. The paper examines the intergrid architecture coupled with a decentralised transactive energy market as a mechanism for permitting higher levels of distributed generation and storage and for energy price reductions, with the Australian energy market used as a case study. The primary contributions of this paper are the development of a decentralised, peer-to-peer (P2P) transactive energy market (TEM) and the derivation of an autonomous agent algorithm capable of monitoring the internal states of agents to place bids and offers to the market accordingly. This paper (part 1 of 2) investigates the behaviour of the TEM and agent algorithm when applied to an isolated intergrid architecture level. The simulation results contained here-within demonstrate that the decentralised TEM and distributed agent algorithm operate in accordance with the desired fundamental principles of economics (supply vs demand), with the potential for significant retail energy price reductions and higher levels of renewable energies.},

In the era of smart cities, the shift from a system that depends upon conventional data management based on ledgers and government records to smarter, immutable and transparent blockchain mode of handling data and its transactions is inevitable. The success of ‘Bitcoin' can be viewed as a proof of the success of blockchain technology, and thus, it should be seen as a breakthrough to solve various issues faced by digitization of transactions and crucial documents. The decentralized architecture of blockchain can support Internet of Things applications, governance of various smart businesses and smart cities beyond our imagination.},

abstract = {As Learners move from one learning environment to another, there is a key necessity of taking with them a proof of previous learning achievements or experiences. In most cases, this is either expressed in terms of receipt of scores or a certificate of completion. While this May be sufficient for enrollment and other administrative decisions, it poses some limitations to the depth of learning analytics and consequently a slow onboarding process. Also, with different institutions having their learning data isolated from each other, it becomes more difficult to easily access a learner's learning history for all learning activities on other systems. In this paper, we propose a blockchain based approach for connecting learning data across different Learning Management Systems (LMS), Learning Record Stores (LRS), institutions and organizations. Leveraging on unique properties of blockchain technology, we also propose solutions to ensuring learning data consistency, availability, immutability, security, privacy and access control.},

abstract = {Background: The rapid development of genetic and genomic technologies, such as next-generation sequencing and genome editing, has made disease treatment much more precise and effective. The technologies' value can only be realized by the aggregation and analysis of people's genomic and health data. However, the collection and sharing of genomic data has many obstacles, including low data quality, information islands, tampering distortions, missing records, leaking of private data, and gray data transactions. Objective: This study aimed to prove that emerging blockchain technology provides a solution for the protection and management of sensitive personal genomic data because of its decentralization, traceability, encryption algorithms, and antitampering features. Methods: This paper describes the case of a blockchain-based genomic big data platform, LifeCODE.ai, to illustrate the means by which blockchain enables the storage and management of genomic data from the perspectives of data ownership, data sharing, and data security. Results: Blockchain opens up new avenues for dealing with data ownership, data sharing, and data security issues in genomic big data platforms and realizes the psychological empowerment of individuals in the platform. Conclusions: The blockchain platform provides new possibilities for the management and security of genetic data and can help realize the psychological empowerment of individuals in the process, and consequently, the effects of data self-governance, incentive-sharing, and security improvement can be achieved. However, there are still some problems in the blockchain that have not been solved, and which require continuous in-depth research and innovation in the future.},

However, it has been witnessed that users in a reputation system often vacillate in providing negative criticism for fear of revenge. The solution is a privacy preserving reputation mechanism that computes reputation in such a way that private feedback of a user is not exposed. Many existing privacy preserving mechanisms rely on a centralized paradigms, hence not suitable for a decentralized environment. Systems that are decentralized are either inadequate or rely on trusted third parties that are expensive and do not protect privacy under severe adversarial models. In this paper, we describe a decentralized reputation system where we ensure that users own privacy is preserved. We implement a protocol that is built into the blockchain technology, by allowing for access control, transactions and data storage that are as indelible as the blockchain itself. Our system computation mechanism is based on a secure multiparty computation by a guaranteed verifiable secret sharing scheme. Our goal is to design a system that computes the reputation of a service provider created on the views of other entities.},

Most existing IIoT infrastructures are based on a centralized architecture, which is easier for management but cannot effectively support immutable and verifiable services among multiple parties. Blockchain technology provides many desired features for large-scale IIoT infrastructures, such as decentralization, trustworthiness, trackability, and immutability. This paper presents a blockchain-based IIoT architecture to support immutable and verifiable services. However, when applying blockchain technology to the IIoT infrastructure, the required storage space posts a grant challenge to resource-constrained IIoT infrastructures. To address the storage issue, this paper proposes a hierarchical blockchain storage structure, ChainSplitter. Specially, the proposed architecture features a hierarchical storage structure where the majority of the blockchain is stored in the clouds, while the most recent blocks are stored in the overlay network of the individual IIoT networks. The proposed architecture seamlessly binds local IIoT networks, the blockchain overlay network, and the cloud infrastructure together through two connectors, the blockchain connector and the cloud connector, to construct the hierarchical blockchain storage. The blockchain connector in the overlay network builds blocks in blockchain from data generated in IIoT networks, and the cloud connector resolves the blockchain synchronization issues between the overlay network and the clouds. We also provide a case study to show the efficiency of the proposed hierarchical blockchain storage in a practical Industrial IoT case.},

The use of the IoT brings numerous opportunities for both service providers and end users, however, it faces critical questions of security and privacy. Toward this, access control is one of the significant security challenges for the IoT, in particular, considering the characteristics of such IoT systems. To develop a secure access control architecture for the IoT, the propagation of access right delegation is a major issue. Many proposals present access control issues for the IoT but given the specific context of access right delegation, it is still in its infancy. This article presents an approach to address such a delegation issue for the IoT using the blockchain technology. We propose a delegation model that employv the critical issues, e.g., the use of nonunique identities, asynchronous and flexible delegation nature of communication for the IoT without the need of a centralized system. The goal of our primitive is to use attributes for validating the identity of an entity instead of relying on a concrete unique identity of an entity. To provide privacy for the attributes, we propose a dual blockchain architecture that moves the attribute storage and access of the public blockchain and onto a secure private blockchain. To demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed approach, we evaluate the system performances using the Ethereum blockchain network.},

One relatively recent approach to address their performance, scalability, privacy, and other problems are to use multiple different DLTs instead of relying on just one. While there are no really established standards for combining several DLTs, a few repeating patterns can be observed. In this paper, we present a survey of interledger approaches, discussing and comparing their underlying mechanisms. A shared motivation for all of the discussed interledger solutions is to move away from the 'one chain rules them all' model to one that allows the interconnection of multiple ledgers, with different features and advantages, while also supporting innovation. The interledger approaches discussed in this survey include 1) atomic cross-chain transactions, 2) transactions across a network of payment channels, 3) the W3C Interledger Protocol (ILP), 4) bridging, 5) sidechains, and 6) ledger-of-ledgers. The approaches are compared according to whether they support the transfer or the exchange of value, their interconnection trust mechanism, complexity, scalability, and transaction cost.},

By using virtualization technologies to move packet processing from dedicated hardware to software, NFV has introduced a new market focused on the offer and distribution of Virtual Network Functions (VNF). Infrastructure Providers (InP) can benefit from an NFV market by providing their infrastructures to fulfill demands of end-users that, in turn, acquire VNFs-As-A-Service (VNFaaS). In this context, solutions that promote the competition between InPs can lead to lower prices, while increasing VNF performance to accommodate specific demands of end-users. In this paper, BRAIN, a blockchain-based reverse auction is presented to introduce an auditable solution in which InPs can compete to host VNFs taking into account the demands of each particular end-user. Such a solution helps reduce costs involved in VNF's commercialization and also monetize NFV-enabled infrastructures. BRAIN is supported by a case study that provides evidence of the solution's feasibility and effectiveness. A discussion regarding blockchain advantages and drawbacks in this use-case (e.g., additional costs and time) concludes this paper.},

Different from most existing works that trade electricity over long distances and through complex meshes, this proposed work performs decentralized and automated demand response through energy sharing of P2P executors. We explore for the first time the benefits of a promising blockchain to conduct the overall ADR framework and increase the P2P trading security. To achieve decentralized scheduling without relying on a central entity, a price-incentive noncooperative game theoretic model is introduced to produce equilibrium solutions for energy storage systems. Moreover, we develop a schedulable ability evaluation system to match trading pairs involving buying and selling nodes. On this basis, a state-machine-driven smart contract mechanism is built to realize P2P trading without reliance on a trusted third party. To illustrate the implementation details of the ADR method, a distributed algorithm is designed. Case studies are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Blockchain as a service (BaaS) is a promising solution to improve the productivity of blockchain application development. However, existing BaaS deployment solutions are mostly vendor-locked: they are either bound to a cloud provider or a blockchain platform. In addition to deployment, design and implementation of blockchain-based applications is a hard task requiring deep expertise. Therefore, this paper presents a unified blockchain as a service platform (uBaaS) to support both design and deployment of blockchain-based applications. The services in uBaaS include deployment as a service, design pattern as a service and auxiliary services. In uBaaS, deployment as a service is platform agnostic, which can avoid lock-in to specific cloud platforms, while design pattern as a service applies design patterns for data management and smart contract design to address the scalability and security issues of blockchain. The proposed solutions are evaluated using a real-world quality tracing use case in terms of feasibility and scalability.},

abstract = {Blockchain as a technology has been successfully deployed in the financial industry. As the technology continues to mature, there are opportunities to use this to solve operational challenges in Aerospace. One of the common use cases is replacing paper records as a proof of compliance with a blockchain enabled distributed ledger. Commonly available open source blockchain frameworks have security ingrained in the components. However, replacing paper records with a blockchain based distributed ledger will require investigation of potential risks involved in the end to end usage of this technology for records management. The objective of this paper is to elucidate potential risks in an aviation record management workflow environment enabled by blockchain and suggest requirements to mitigate the risks. In addition requirements for Blockchain based systems will be proposed, which will guarantee minimum functional requirements like Protection of confidential informationIntegrity of the information in a recordSafeguards against unauthorized access The potential gaps are understood using an illustrative end to end blockchain based process along with their conceptual high level intermediate steps. For example: Authenticated trusted digital identities of the participants whose transactions are recorded in distributed ledgersTrusted source which distributes these identities and has a mechanism to update, revoke and safely secure these identitiesTrusted methods to ensure detection if the digital identities are compromisedTrusted method to demonstrate controlled authorization process for digital identities as per access control rulesTrusted methods to demonstrate the generation of accounting logs.},

abstract = {The ubiquitous ID (uID) architecture provides dynamic and flexible context-awareness frameworks necessary in ubiquitous computing. Its basic idea is to assign 128 bit unique identifiers, each of which is called a ucode (ubiquitous code), to real-world entities. To guarantee the uniqueness of ucodes, current ucode ownreships are maintained by a hierarchical structure like DNS. In this traditional system, processing ucode transactions between organizations is cumbersome and inefficient because the reliability of owner information is dependent on individual organizations. To solve this problem, we designed a ucode ownership management system on a blockchain which is a decentralized platform. In this system, we proposed a blockchain-based ucode allocation method, which requires a simple procedure and only one transaction. This proposed method is user-friendly and efficient compared with ucode allocation methods to which we simply apply current blockchain-based name registration methods requiring a complex procedure and at least two transactions. Finally, we conducted a case study about these ucode allocation methods built on the Ethereum blockchain. From this result, we compared the usability and security of each ucode allocation method in Ethereum.},

However, a service oriented architecture (SOA) is difficult to provide scalable and extensible services in a city-wide distributed Internet of Things (IoT)-based SPS system. Furthermore, traditional management and security solutions rely on a centralized authority, which can be the performance bottleneck or single point of failure. Inspired by the microservices architecture and blockchain technology, a Lightweight IoT based Smart Public Safety (LISPS) framework is proposed on top of a permissioned blockchain network. Through decoupling a monolithic complex system into independent sub-tasks, the LISPS system possesses high flexibility in the design process and online maintenance. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the approach to provide a secured data sharing and access control mechanism.},

The rights of subjects to access such resources are typically expressed through access control policies, which are evaluated at access request time against the current access context. This paper proposes a new approach based on blockchain technology to publish the policies expressing the right to access a resource and to allow the distributed transfer of such right among users. In our proposed protocol the policies and the rights exchanges are publicly visible on the blockchain, consequently any user can know at any time the policy paired with a resource and the subjects who currently have the rights to access the resource. This solution allows distributed auditability, preventing a party from fraudulently denying the rights granted by an enforceable policy. We also show a possible working implementation based on XACML policies, deployed on the Bitcoin blockchain.},

abstract = {The Fourth Industrial Revolution is centered around a self-organized production. Cyber-physical systems can be used to collect and share data for tracking, automation and control as well as evaluation and documentation. This has a wide-reaching impact on business models. Instead of a linear approach, concentrating on a single company, the focus needs to be on the complete production ecosystem represented by a dynamic and self-organized network, including the supply chain. The interconnectedness of the cyber-physical systems in these networks is rooted in the Internet of Things, but also shared business processes. Performance, stability, security as well as data integrity and access control hereby represent a major contributing factor, calling for a new concept of information processing systems. The blockchain is a distributed ledger combining cryptographic and game-theoretic concepts, which enable immutable transactions and automatic consensus of the parties involved about its state. Blockchains have evolved as a fast-developing technology, promising increased efficiency and security in many scenarios, especially use cases that primarily rely on all kinds of transactions. The paper follows a design science approach, examining the implications of blockchain and the industrial Internet of Things in Industry 4.0 (I40) on supply chain management. I40's implications on supply chains are discussed and connected with favorable characteristics of blockchain technology. Based on this analysis, requirements for a decentralized enterprise information processing system are derived, resulting in a reference model for distributed supply chains of I40.},

abstract = {Recently, technology startups have leveraged the potential of blockchain-based technologies to govern institutions or interpersonal trust by enforcing signed treaties among different individuals in a decentralized environment. However, it is going to be hard enough convincing that the blockchain technology could completely replace the trust among trading partners in the sharing economy as sharing services always operate in a highly dynamic environment.With the rapid expanding of the rental market, the sharing economy faces more and more severe challenges in the form of regulatory uncertainty and concerns about abuses. This paper proposes an enhanced decentralized sharing economy service using the service level agreement (SLA), which documents the services the provider will furnish and defines the service standards the provider is obligated to meet. The SLA specifications are defined as the smart contract, which facilitates multi-user collaboration and automates the process with no involvement of the third party. To demonstrate the usability of the proposed solution in the sharing economy, a notebook sharing case study is implemented using the Hyperledger Fabric. The functionalities of the smart contract are tested using the Hyperledger Composer. Moreover, the efficiency of the designed approach is demonstrated through a series of experimental tests using different performance metrics.},

Faced with the potential privacy issues and vulnerabilities existing in current personal health data storage and sharing systems, as well as the concept of self-sovereign data ownership, we propose an innovative user-centric health data sharing solution by utilizing a decentralized and permissioned blockchain to protect privacy using channel formation scheme and enhance the identity management using the membership service supported by the blockchain. A mobile application is deployed to collect health data from personal wearable devices, manual input, and medical devices, and synchronize data to the cloud for data sharing with healthcare providers and health insurance companies. To preserve the integrity of health data, within each record, a proof of integrity and validation is permanently retrievable from cloud database and is anchored to the blockchain network. Moreover, for scalable and performance considerations, we adopt a tree-based data processing and batching method to handle large data sets of personal health data collected and uploaded by the mobile platform.},

abstract = {Smart interconnected vehicles generate a huge amount of data to be used by a wide range of applications. Although cloud based data management is currently in practice, for many applications serving road safety or traffic regulation, it is utmost important that applications access these data at the site itself for improved quality of service. Road side units (RSUs) play a crucial role in handling these vast amount of vehicular data and serving the running applications in turn. In this current era of edge computing, in-place data access is also proven to be advantageous from cost point of view. As multiple applications from different service providers are interested to access different fragments of these data, a robust access control mechanism is needed to ensure desired level of security as well as reliability for these data. In this paper, we introduce B2VDM, a novel architecture for vehicular data management at RSUs, that provides a seamless access control using Blockchain technology. The proposed B2VDM framework also implements a simple load distribution module, which maintains the reliability by minimizing the number of packet drops at a heavily loaded RSU during peak hours. An extensive evaluation using Etherium Blockchain validates the effectiveness of the proposed architecture.},

Furthermore, technology like the Internet has been a fertile ground for innovation and creativity. One such disruptive innovation is blockchain-a keystone of cryptocurrencies. The blockchain technology is presented as a game changer for many of the existing and emerging technologies/services. With its immutability property and decentralised architecture, it is taking centre stage in many services as an equalisation factor to the current parity between consumers and large corporations/governments. One potential application of the blockchain is in e-voting schemes. The objective of such a scheme would be to provide a decentralised architecture to run and support a voting scheme that is open, fair, and independently verifiable. In this paper, we propose a potential new e-voting protocol that utilises the blockchain as a transparent ballot box. The protocol has been designed to adhere to fundamental e-voting properties as well as offer a degree of decentralisation and allow for the voter to change/update their vote (within the permissible voting period). This paper highlights the pros and cons of using blockchain for such a proposal from a practical point view in both development/deployment and usage contexts. Concluding the paper is a potential roadmap for blockchain technology to be able to support complex applications.},

abstract = {In a bid to stamp out fraudulent crime, there is increased pressure on individuals to provide evidence that they possess a 'real' identity. Counterfeiting and fake identities have reduced confidence in traditional paper documentation as proof of identity, this has created a demand for an intelligent digital alternative. Recent government implementations and identity trends have also improved the popularity of digital forms of identification.Authentication of identity is a salient issue in the current climate where identity theft through record duplication is on the rise. Identity resolution techniques have proven effective in filtering duplicated and fake records in identity management systems. These techniques have been further improved by the implementation of machine learning techniques which are capable of revealing patterns and links that have formerly gone undetected. Research has also suggested that incorporating non-standard attributes in the form of social contextual data can increase the efficiency and success-rate of these fraud detection methods.In the digital age where individuals are creating large digital footprints, online accounts and activities can prove to be a valuable source of information that may contribute to 'proof' that an asserted identity is genuine. Online social contextual data-or 'Digital identities'-pertaining to real people are built over time and bolstered by associated accounts, relationships and attributes. This data is difficult to fake and therefore may have the capacity to provide proof of a 'real' identity.This paper outlines the design and initial development of a solution that utilizes data sourced from an individual's digital footprint to assess the likelihood that it pertains to a 'real' identity. This is achieved through application of machine learning and Bayesian probabilistic modelling techniques. Where identity sources are considered reliable, a secure and intelligent digital identification artefact will be created. This artefact will emulate a blockchain-inspired ledger and may subsequently be used to prove identity in place of traditional paper documentation.},

The current model in which a third party manages individually data is starting to reach its limits. The block-chain model, popularized by the Bitcoin in the financial space, is growing and demonstrating that using a decentralized network of peers can lead to a secured and powerful computing. Present paper describes the implementation of a decentralized personal data management system. It ensures users own and control their data. We implement and test here a concrete application of the block-chain. It allows our system to avoid the usage of a traditional third-party role by managing an automated access-control system profitable to the user. Finally, we open a discussion on the possibility to set up an economic system based on the exchanges of tokens between the different entities of the solution.},

abstract = {As cloud storage becomes more common, data security is an increasing concern. In this paper, we propose a new approach to control access to the user's data stored in the cloud with the state-of-the-arts decentralized blockchain technology. In general, an access control solution for cloud data involves three components: authentication, authorization and auditing. It is expensive for the cloud server to ensure authentication, authorization and auditing for access control of the user's data in cloud computing environment. In addition, it is hard to prevent the malicious cloud server from access to the user's data and disclose the user's privacy. Our approach distributes the access control tasks for authentication, authorization and auditing to a network of nodes like bitcoin. In particular, we keep the auditing records in the transparent blockchain. In addition, we employ the Shamir secret sharing scheme to manage the encryption key for cloud users.},

In order to ensure the convenience of medical services, many related organizations need to share EHRs across organizations to exchange information. The existing private EHR shareable schemes still contain some security issues, e.g., unreliability of cloud service provider, complex key calculation and unreliable backward security. In this paper, we propose an attribute-based access control scheme based on the smart contract (ABAC-SC). By virtue of the blockchain technique, ABAC-SC can be directly embedded into the existing private EHRs shareable system to solve existing unsafe problems. Considering the storage constraints of the blockchain, a data processing solution is designed to reduce the storage requirements of the pre-data upload process. We simulate our ABAC-SC scheme in Ethereum's test network Rinkeby, and the experimental results show the feasibility of our solution.},

However, industrial espionage, cyber-crime and deplorable politically driven cyber-interventions threaten to disrupt and/or physically damage the critical infrastructure that supports national wealth generation and preserves the health, safety and welfare of the populous. The purpose of this paper is to present a comprehensive review of cyber-threats confronting critical infrastructure asset management reliant upon a common data environment to augment building information modelling (BIM) implementation. Design/methodology/approach: An interpretivist, methodological approach to reviewing pertinent literature (that contained elements of positivism) was adopted. The ensuing mixed methods analysis: reports upon case studies of cyber-physical attacks; reveals distinct categories of hackers; identifies and reports upon the various motivations for the perpetrators/actors; and explains the varied reconnaissance techniques adopted. Findings: The paper concludes with direction for future research work and a recommendation to utilize innovative block chain technology as a potential risk mitigation measure for digital built environment vulnerabilities. Originality/value: While cyber security and digitization of the built environment have been widely covered within the extant literature in isolation, scant research has hitherto conducted an holistic review of the perceived threats, deterrence applications and future developments in a digitized Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Operations (AECO) sector. This review presents concise and lucid reference guidance that will intellectually challenge, and better inform, both practitioners and researchers in the AECO field of enquiry.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {In modern e-Healthcare systems, human activity recognition (HAR) is one of the most challenging tasks in remote monitoring of patients suffering from mental illness or disabilities for necessary assistance. One of the major issues is to provide security to a number of different connected devices to the Internet, known as Internet of Things (IoT). A potential solution to this problem is the blockchain-based architecture. In addition, the complex nature of activities performed by humans in diverse healthcare environments reduces the qualitative measures for extracting distinct features representing various human actions. To answer this challenge, we propose an activity monitoring and recognition framework, which is based on multi-class cooperative categorization procedure to improve the activity classification accuracy in videos supporting the fog or cloud computing-based blockchain architecture. In the proposed approach, frame-based salient features are extracted from videos consisting of different human activities, which are further processed into action vocabulary for efficiency and accuracy. Similarly, the classification of activities is performed using support vector machine (SVM) based on the error-correction-output-codes (ECOC) framework. It has been observed through experimental results that the proposed approach is more efficient and achieves higher accuracy regarding human activity recognition as compared to other state-of-the-art action recognition approaches.},

As far as IoT systems are concerned, most of them are built on centralized architectures, which reveal various assailable points in data security and privacy threats. Hence, this paper aims to investigate these issues by delegating the responsibility of a verification monitor from a centralized architecture to a decentralized manner using blockchain technology. We present a smart contract-based task management scheme to provide runtime verification of device behaviors and allows trustworthy access control to these devices. The business logic of the proposed system is specified by the smart contract, which automates all time-consuming processes cryptographically and correctly. The usability of the proposed solution is further demonstrated by implementing a prototype application in which the Hyperledger Fabric is utilized to implement the business logic for runtime verification and access control with one desktop and one Raspberry Pi. A comprehensive evaluation experiment is conducted, and the results indicate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed system.},

At the same time, the LN faces its own challenges like transaction path lengths, centralization of channels (hubs), channel imbalances (depletion), etc. Here we study the effects of payment channel fees on these various factors. To get realistic insights, we based our study on empirical Bitcoin transaction patterns and existing LN structure, and apply a simple form of fee structure with only one tunable parameter, $\alpha$, that is most influential on the transaction routing paths. We assume the transactions through the LN take the path of the lowest aggregate fees, and found as a consequence that one cannot have short average path lengths and low overall channel imbalances at the same time. A good compromise is to have fees proportional to the square root of the channel capacity, such that reasonably short path lengths and overall balanced channel capacities can be achieved that makes the operation of the LN more sustainable.},

However, when data is shared amongst many users, the data management system should not only support access control, but also provide traceability of the different operations made on the sensitive data. Also data is duplicated to ensure the availability of the data. Unfortunately the amount of redundant copies of the same data leads to storage waste. In our paper we propose an architecture for data management based on Blockchain Principle to provide traceability of the updates on data while guaranteeing its security through a combination of hashing and encryption techniques. Our model will adapt the Blockchain technology to a centralized environment and supports a heterogeneous deduplication of redundant data in data centers. We evaluate the efficiency of the scheme on the basis of the time consumed for encryption and decryption of big or small data as well as the security level of the proposed model.},

abstract = {The set of distributed ledger architectures known as blockchain is best known for cryptocurrency applications such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. These permissionless block chains are showing the potential to be disruptive to the financial services industry. Their broader adoption is likely to be limited by the maximum block size, the cost of the Proof of Work consensus mechanism, and the increasing size of any given chain overwhelming most of the participating nodes. These factors have led to many cryptocurrency blockchains to become centralized in the nodes with enough computing power and storage to be a dominant miner and validator. Permissioned chains operate in trusted environments and can, therefore, avoid the computationally expensive consensus mechanisms. Permissioned chains are still susceptible to asset storage demands and non-standard user interfaces that will impede their adoption. This paper describes an approach to addressing these limitations: permissioned blockchain that uses off-chain storage of the data assets and this is accessed through a standard browser and mobile app. The implementation in the Hyperledger framework is described as is an example use of patient-centered health data management.},

Compared to the traditional surveillance systems that is built following a monolithic architecture to carry out lower level operations, such as monitoring and recording, the modern surveillance systems are expected to support more scalable and decentralized solutions for advanced video stream analysis at the large volumes of distributed edge devices. In addition, the centralized architecture of the conventional surveillance systems is vulnerable to single point of failure and privacy breach owning to the lack of protection to the surveillance feed. This position paper introduces a novel secure smart surveillance system based on microservices architecture and blockchain technology. Encapsulating the video analysis algorithms as various independent microservices not only isolates the video feed from different sectors, but also improve the system availability and robustness by decentralizing the operations. The blockchain technology securely synchronizes the video analysis databases among microservices across surveillance domains, and provides tamper proof of data in the trustless network environment. Smart contract enabled access authorization strategy prevents any unauthorized user from accessing the microservices and offers a scalable, decentralized and fine-grained access control solution for smart surveillance systems.},

Hence, we introduce AcadCoin, a novel cryptocurrency used for supporting said financial transactions. Also, the Hyperledger blockchain provides user access control to achieve double-blindness in reviews. Along with the Hyperledger blockchain, the IPFS is used to store the paper documents, review documents and open metrics documents to reduce the storage requirement of the blockchain. A broad system architecture is constructed to combine the blockchain and the file storage system. This system architecture distributes nodes of the system to related parties.

From that perspective, Smart Grids are a mixture of physical actuators, sensors, physical communication networks; and cyber computational and communication protocols and algorithms. In our work, we propose to extend the applicability of decentralized blockchain consensus protocols to the broad field of Cyber–Physical systems. Our contribution includes a proposal of a new family of cyber–physical systems, an in-depth discussion of new possibilities and inherent shortcomings. The proposed coupling of the data storage mechanisms, communication and consensus protocols, allows for deployment of self-sustaining cyber–physical environments in which all the mission-critical aspects in both the cyber and physical layer are effectively incentivized, coordinated and maintained. This includes the essential data storage, data exchange, but also the production, transmission and distribution of energy. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first such a comprehensive undertaking toward symbiotic cyber–physical systems and environments. The proposed family of systems is decentralized and does not imply the necessity of reliance on trusted third parties. We propose and discuss an architecture which incorporates physical, blockchain-enabled sensors and actuators capable of monitoring and altering parameters of the underlying physical layer. We analyze a particular instance of a blockchain-aided CPS' where we are concerned with the power grid at both the micro and macro-grid level. At the macro-grid level we explore the possibility of utilizing blockchain-enabled physical actuators. These theoretical actuators are able to introduce savings by a near real-time routing of energy and enable for tracking of power losses thanks to decentralized accountability. At the micro-grid level we propose a network of blockchain-enabled smart meters to coordinate real-time auction-based energy trade. To glue together the elements of such an open, trustless, decentralized system, we discuss an intrinsic communication protocol capable of rewarding intermediaries of a data exchange for each transmitted byte. We tackle the feasibility, security and accountability challenges which we have faced and which will need to be considered by future architects of the new, exciting family of cyber–physical systems.},

abstract = {Secure data ownership management is significant for realizing personal and private data sharing, which can be widely used with consumer electronics. The notion of the decentralized privacy (DP) is introduced by Zyskind et al., and accordingly the first DP system is implemented through blockchain and off-blockchain distributed hashtable. To address the efficiency and overhead issues, we present a conceptually simple solution directly from smart contracts with cryptographic primitives. Our system is called the smart contract-based decentralized privacy (SCDP) system. We propose the basic SCDP system as a warm-up to introduce the design principle based on symmetric encryption. Moreover, the strong SCDP system is provided by using ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption for supporting more flexible scenarios of access control and also eliminating some limitations of the basic system.},

Without an interworking model for the air interface, existing network designs continue to tie wireless medium access to that of the backhaul provider for ownership of access and identity trust, resulting in limitations on functionality and coverage.In this paper, we propose a novel solution to access ownership and identity trust by extending the TCP network standard, under a new model we propose, named TCP-Air which integrates distributed ledger technologies directly at the air interface. Further, we present two use cases of the TCP-Air model, demonstrating applications not feasible under existing permissioned-Access network designs.},

In this research, we will apply this concept in a simple game application. Bluetooth technology will be used to calculate the object's positions by using RTT and other data from mobile sensors and apply them in kinematics equations. This application allows building a map of objects positions relative to each other. Blockchain will be used to save this data and assure its accuracy and correctness.

@article{Huang_2020,
abstract = {Known as a distributed ledger, blockchain is becoming prevalent due to its decentralization, traceability and tamper resistance. Particularly, permissioned blockchain such as Hyperledger Fabric shows great application prospects as the infrastructure of IoT security, credit management, etc. Many cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, Oracle and IBM cloud currently provide blockchain as a service, in which tenants can quickly build permissioned blockchain and run smart contract based applications. However, the transactions throughput and scalability in the permissioned blockchain are not ideal, despite many optimization efforts in consensus protocol and parallel chain. Existing solutions still reveals some limitations like excessive CPU scheduling, inefficient block broadcast and high latency of initial blocks synchronization when new nodes join blockchain network. Inspired by the emerging RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access) network, we propose BoR, an RDMA-based permissioned blockchain framework. By offloading the block transfer transaction into RDMA NICs, it can increase block broadcast speed and reduce block sync delay. We exploit the RDMA primitives to redesign the block synchronization protocol and accelerate DPoS (Delegated Proof of Stake) consensus process for higher throughput and lower latency in kernel-bypass manner. As demonstrated in our evaluation with different workloads, BoR with lower CPU utilization significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art EoS blockchain.},

The global information technology scene is being overcrowded with blockchain applications with special focus on the vast healthcare market [12]. The value of information related to healthcare creates a clear path for applying blockchain as a solution for some of the challenges in the healthcare sector, in particular with the goal of creating a fair and transparent way for sharing information and patient data. It is however a fact that while blockchain technology introduces additional complexity to the implementation healthcare software, the benefit the technology actually brings still remains unclear and difficult to evaluate. This vision paper demonstrates our research focus on providing a body of knowledge and tools to help evaluate this impact of blockchain on eHealth applications. In particular, we identify that such a research effort has to explicitly consider cost of addressing challenges inherent to the eHealth domain like integration of disparate software systems (hospitals, research institutions, government agencies, health insurance and pharmaceutical companies, etc.), the potential introduction of cryptocurrencies in healthcare systems, degree of patient service improvement, transparency and compliance to laws and regulations, and others. The more traditional influencing factors, like cost of development and running, licenses for using third-party software services, and the ones inherent to blockchain like cost of computation and energy will also have to be taken into consideration in the metrics model.},

@article{Sternberg_2020,
abstract = {Despite the anticipated benefits and the numerous announcements of pilot cases, we have seen very few successful implementations of blockchain technology (BCT) solutions in supply chains. Little is empirically known about the obstacles to blockchain adoption, particularly in a supply chain's interorganizational setting. In supply chains, blockchains' benefits, for example, BCT-based tracking and tracing, are dependent on a critical mass of supply chain actors adopting the technology. While previous research has mainly been conceptual and has lacked both theory and empirical data, we propose a theory-based model for interorganizational adoption of BCT. We use the proposed model to analyze a unique in-depth revelatory case study. Our case study confirms previous conceptual work and reveals a paradox as well as several tensions between drivers for and against (positive and negative determining factors, respectively) of BCT adoption that must be managed in an interorganizational setting. In this vertical context, the adoption and integration decision of one supply chain actor recursively affects the adoption and integration decisions of the other supply chain actors. This paper contributes midrange theory on BCT in supply chain management (SCM), future research directions, and managerial insights on BCT adoption in supply chains.},

While service-oriented architecture (SOA) has been adopted by IoT and cyber-physical systems (CPS), it is difficult for a monolithic architecture to provide scalable and extensible services for a distributed IoT based SPS system. Furthermore, traditional security solutions rely on a centralized authority, which can be a performance bottleneck or single point failure. Inspired by microservices architecture and blockchain technology, this paper proposes a BLockchain-ENabled Decentralized Microservices Architecture for Smart public safety (BlendMAS). Within a permissioned blockchain network, a microservices based security mechanism is introduced to secure data access control in an SPS system. The functionality of security services is decoupled into separate containerized microservices that are built using a smart contract and deployed on edge and fog computing nodes.

abstract = {Modern healthcare systems are characterized as being highly complex and costly. However, this can be reduced through improved health record management, utilization of insurance agencies, and blockchain technology. Blockchain was first introduced to provide distributed records of money-related exchanges that were not dependent on centralized authorities or financial institutions. Breakthroughs in blockchain technology have led to improved transactions involving medical records, insurance billing, and smart contracts, enabling permanent access to and security of data, as well as providing a distributed database of transactions. One significant advantage of using blockchain technology in the healthcare industry is that it can reform the interoperability of healthcare databases, providing increased access to patient medical records, device tracking, prescription databases, and hospital assets, including the complete life cycle of a device within the blockchain infrastructure. Access to patients' medical histories is essential to correctly prescribe medication, with blockchain being able to dramatically enhance the healthcare services framework. In this paper, several solutions for improving current limitations in healthcare systems using blockchain technology are explored, including frameworks and tools to measure the performance of such systems, e.g., Hyperledger Fabric, Composer, Docker Container, Hyperledger Caliper, and the Wireshark capture engine. Further, this paper proposes an Access Control Policy Algorithm for improving data accessibility between healthcare providers, assisting in the simulation of environments to implement the Hyperledger-based eletronic healthcare record (EHR) sharing system that uses the concept of a chaincode. Performance metrics in blockchain networks, such as latency, throughput, Round Trip Time (RTT). have also been optimized for achieving enhanced results. Compared to traditional EHR systems, which use client-server architecture, the proposed system uses blockchain for improving efficiency and security.},

The final solution presents optimal content for the ledger (extracted from the current folio), preserves current land transactions, has reassigned duties to state validators and has got away with the folio system while ensuring derivation of the pedigree/folio tree for a land at a given time. A regional distributed land ledger representing the present regional ledger system and an island wide unified land ledger which addresses unequal regional land transaction density conditions across the island were proposed as solution models. The proposed models of the solution were implemented using Hyperledger Fabric v1.2. They were evaluated for performance on an AWS t2.large instance with 2 vCPUs, 8GiB memory, under different land transaction density conditions and node failure conditions. A community consisting of twenty-one peers belonging to nine organizations, was subject to evaluation. The island wide solution records higher throughput, lower latency and tolerance for fail-stop conditions than the regional distributed land ledger. Further, the island wide solution does not show a significant drop in throughput up to two crash failures out of seven Kafka brokers in production scale deployment.},

abstract = {The ubiquitous use of Internet of Things (IoT) ranges from industrial control systems to e-Health, e-commerce, smart cities, agriculture, supply chain management, smart cars, cyber-physical systems and a lot more. However, the data collected and processed by IoT systems especially the ones with centralized control are vulnerable to availability, integrity, and privacy threats. Hence, we present “PrivySharing,” a blockchain-based innovative framework for privacy-preserving and secure IoT data sharing in a smart city environment. The proposed scheme is distinct from existing strategies on many aspects. The data privacy is preserved by dividing the blockchain network into various channels, where every channel comprises a finite number of authorized organizations and processes a specific type of data such as health, smart car, smart energy or financial details. Moreover, access to users' data within a channel is controlled by embedding access control rules in the smart contracts. In addition, data within a channel is further isolated and secured by using private data collection and encryption respectively. Likewise, the REST API that enables clients to interact with the blockchain network has dual security in the form of an API Key and OAuth 2.0. The proposed solution conforms to some of the significant requirements outlined in the European Union General Data Protection Regulation. We also present a system of reward in the form of a digital token named “PrivyCoin” for users sharing their data with stakeholders/third parties. Lastly, the experimental outcomes advocate that a multi-channel blockchain scales well as compared to a single-channel blockchain system.},

abstract = {Since the introduction of Internet of Things (IoT), e-health has become one of the main research topics. Due to the sensitivity of patient data, preserving the privacy of patients appears to be challenging. In healthcare applications, patient data are usually stored in the cloud, which makes it difficult for the users to have enough control over their data. However, due to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), it is the data subject's right to know where and how his data has been stored, who can access his data and to what extent. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based architecture for e-health applications which provides an efficient privacy-preserving access control mechanism. We take advantage of Blockchain (BC) special features, i.e., immutability and anonymity of users, while modifying the classic blockchain structure in order to overcome its challenges in IoT applications (i.e., low throughput, high overhead and latency). To this end, we cluster the miners of BC, store and process data at the nearest cluster to the patient. While our proposal is a work in progress, we provide a security analysis of our proposed architecture.},

abstract = {To ensure public safety and security, it is vitally important for governments to collect information from businesses and analyse it. Such information can be used to determine whether transported goods might be suspicious and therefore require physical inspection. Although businesses are obliged to report some information, they are reluctant to share additional information for fear of sharing competitively sensitive information, becoming liable and not being compliant with the law. These reasons are often overlooked in the design of software architectures for information sharing. In the present research, we followed a design science approach to develop a software architecture for business-to-government information sharing. Based on literature and a case study, we elicited the requirements an architecture that provides for the sharing of information should meet to make it acceptable to businesses. We then developed the architecture and evaluated it against the requirements. The architecture consists of a blockchain that stores events and rules for information sharing that are controlled by businesses. For each event, two parties use their private keys to encrypt its Merkle root to confirm that they know the data are correct. This makes it easy to check whether information is reliable and whether an event should be accepted. Access control, metadata and context information enable the context-based sharing of information.

abstract = {Efficient and secure electronic communication is crucial for successful business-to-business processes. Due to the weaknesses of e-mail communication, a shift towards instant messaging can also be observed in this context. However, reliance on instant-messaging solutions in business processes has its own drawbacks such as the lack of archiving capabilities and unsatisfactory legal compliance. Furthermore, special business scenarios such as bidding processes come with complex security requirements that are not met by current instant-messaging solutions. To also enable efficient and secure electronic communication for these scenarios, we propose a blockchain-based instant-messaging solution under the name SeDiCom. SeDiCom employs the capabilities of the blockchain technology, one-time identities, and the Tor anonymity network to enable confidential instant messaging without leaking any identifying metadata. Our proposed solution provides non-repudiation, censorship resistance, integrated backup facilities, and verifiable notices of receipt, while inherently preventing man-in-the-middle attacks and virtually all other forms of eavesdropping. By this means, SeDiCom enables efficient and secure electronic communication for business scenarios with special security requirements while also catering to today's usage patterns.},

With the rapid increase of vehicles, many problems arise in the network such as cost, scalability, security and trust management. To address these problems, we proposed the trust management system through blockchain based authentication of the vehicles by assigning unique identification. If still malicious vehicles exist in the network, trust is achieved by calculating the data that is sent from the vehicles so that network does not get stuck due to malicious data. In addition, we also proposed the crowdsensing concept using vehicles' sensors data and we minimize the cost of deploying the sensors and also optimize the density of area with respect to chance minimum occurrence of vehicles. We performed these solutions on the etheriam environment. vehicle to vehicle and vehicle to infrastructure communication got secured from malicious vehicles and malicious data. In crowdsensing, cost is reduced as compared to the wireless sensor network.},

Through the risk assessment system, it is possible to quantify the possibility of the impact or loss caused by an event before or after an event, thereby avoiding the risk or reducing the loss. However, the existing risk assessment system architecture is mostly a centralized architecture, which could lead to problems such as data leakage, tampering, and central cheating. Combined with the technology of block chain, which has the characteristics of decentralization, security and credibility, collective maintenance, and untamperability. This paper proposes a new block chain-based risk assessment system architecture and a consensus mechanism algorithm based on DPOS improvement. This architecture uses an improved consensus mechanism to achieve a safe and efficient risk assessment solving the problem of data tampering in the risk assessment process, avoiding data leakage caused by improper data storage. A convenient, safe and fast risk assessment is achieved in conjunction with the improved consensus mechanism. In addition, by comparing existing risk assessment architecture, the advantages and impacts of the new block chain-based risk assessment system architecture are analyzed.},

This paper develops an optimization model and blockchain-based architecture to manage the operation of crowdsourced energy systems (CESs), with peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading transactions (ETTs). An operational model of CESs in distribution networks is presented considering various types of ETT and crowdsourcees. Then, a two-phase operation algorithm is presented: Phase I focuses on the day-ahead scheduling of generation and controllable DERs, whereas Phase II is developed for hour-ahead or real-time operation of distribution networks. The developed approach supports seamless P2P energy trading between individual prosumers and/or the utility. The presented operational model can also be used to operate islanded microgrids. The CES framework and the operation algorithm are then prototyped through an efficient blockchain implementation, namely, the IBM Hyperledger Fabric. This implementation allows the system operator to manage the network users to seamlessly trade energy. Case studies and prototype illustration are provided.},

abstract = {Smart cities have emerged as a hub of intelligent applications (e.g., intelligent transportation systems, smart parking, smart homes, and e-healthcare) to provide ambient-assisted living and quality of experience to wide communities of users. The smooth execution of these applications depends on reliable data transmission between various smart devices and machines. However, the exponential increase in data traffic due to the growing dependency of end users on smart city applications has created various bottlenecks (e.g., channel congestion, manual flow configurations, limited scalability, and low flexibility) on the conventional network backbone, which can degrade the performance of any designed solution in this environment. To mitigate these challenges, SDN emerges as a powerful new technology that provides global visibility of the network by decoupling the control logic from the forwarding devices. The abstraction of network services in SDN architecture provides more flexibility for network administrators to execute various applications. In SDN architecture, the decision making process is handled by a logically centralized controller, which may have a single point of failure. An adversary/ attacker can compromise the controller using different types of attacks (e.g., eavesdropping, man-in-the middle attack, and distributed denial of service) in order to gain total control of the network by updating the flow table entries at the data plane or hindering control plane operations. Therefore, to cope with the aforementioned challenges, new strategies and solutions are required for securing the SDN-enabled network architecture at different planes and their associated interconnections. In this article, various security issues and different attack vectors are discussed along with possible solutions. To mitigate various attacks, BlockSDN, a blockchain as a service framework, for SDN is proposed. The architecture of permissioned blockchain is presented followed by two attack scenarios, 1) a malware compromised switch at the data plane and 2) distributed denial of service attack at the control plane, to demonstrate the applicability of the BlockSDN framework for various future applications. Finally, the open issues and challenges with respect to the design of blockchain solutions for SDN in smart city applications are also discussed.},

abstract = {Blockchain is an emerging decentralized architecture and distributed computing paradigm and has recently attracted intensive attention from all sectors of society. This paper sets up a theoretical model to analyze a new credit pattern that allows small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) assessing bank loans through the blochchain technology. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the blockchain technology enables the decentralized consensus recording of success of debt repayment or debt default rendered by verifying and validating certain lending and borrowing activities in distributed ledgers. In the newly proposed blockchain embedded credit system, SMEs with low-risk and high-quality could display their credibility and risk class through information distribution. They are more likely to access bank loans even if they are not able to provide collateral. Results derived from the theoretical model present two main findings. First, the alleviation of information asymmetry and credit rationing problems can be achieved through decentralized consensus and information distribution among all participants. Second, the risk sharing mechanism involving government, banks and firms, will not only make the establishment of such an innovative system possible, but also create risk pool for the blockchain based lending and borrowing.},

abstract = {Data sharing and content offloading among vehicles is an imperative part of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). A peer-to-peer connection among vehicles in a distributed manner is a highly promising solution for fast communication among vehicles. To ensure security and data tracking, existing studies use blockchain as a solution. The Blockchain-enabled Internet of Vehicles (BIoV) requires high computation power for the miners to mine the blocks and let the chain grow. Over and above, the blockchain consensus is probabilistic and the block generated today can be eventually declared as a fork and can be pruned from the chain. This reduces the overall efficiency of the protocol because the correct work done initially is eventually not used if it becomes a fork. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a Directed Acyclic Graph enabled IoV (DAGIoV) framework. We make use of a tangle data structure where each node acts as a miner and eventually the network achieves consensus among the nodes. A game-theoretic approach is used to model the interactions between the vehicles providing and consuming offloading services. The proposed model is proven to be highly scalable and well suited for microtransactions or frequent data transfer among the nodes in the vehicular network.},

While leveraging the large-scale IoT-based applications like Smart Gird or Smart Cities, IoT also incurs more concerns on privacy and security. Among the top security challenges that IoT face, access authorization is critical in resource sharing and information protection. One of the weaknesses of today's access control (AC) is the centralized authorization server, which can be the performance bottleneck or the single point of failure. In this paper, BlendCAC, a blockchain-enabled decentralized capability-based AC is proposed for the security of IoTs. The BlendCAC aims at an effective access control processes to devices, services and information in large scale IoT systems. Based on the blockchain network, a capability delegation mechanism is suggested for access permission propagation. A robust identity-based capability token management strategy is proposed, which takes advantage of a smart contract for registration, propagation and revocation of the access authorization. In the proposed BlendCAC scheme, IoT devices are their own master to control their resources instead of being supervised by a centralized authority. Implemented and tested on a Raspberry Pi device and on a local private blockchain network, the experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed BlendCAC approach to offer a decentralized, scalable, lightweight and fine-grained AC solution to IoT systems.},

Since, these transactions are available to everyone, bitcoins must be stored in a secured wallet. These bitcoin wallets can be opened only by its secret key. And if once the secret key of the wallet is lost, it cannot be recovered because of the irreversible nature of bitcoin transaction. To root out this problem, Goldfeder et al. [4] proposed a solution of threshold signature scheme compatible with bitcoins signature by using Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) providing security policy of shared control of a wallet in which each player gets only a single share. Considering an important point of priority/weightage of players, Dikshit and Singh [12] first proposed a scheme in which each player is given one or more shares of the secret key according to his weightage/priority. This scheme has a drawback of managing and handling many keys by each player. Suppose a player has weightage w, then he possesses w different shares of secret key. This problem is resolved in the proposed scheme in this paper. We propose a scheme in which all the players get single share and can accomplish the requirements of concept of weightage. We extend the weighted threshold ECDSA scheme in order to realize efficient weighted threshold ECDSA scheme.},

abstract = {The advent of blockchain technology can refine the concept of DTs by ensuring transparency, decentralized data storage, data immutability, and peer-to-peer communication in industrial sectors. A DT is an integrated multiphysics, multiscale, and probabilistic simulation, representation, and mirroring of a real-world physical component. The DTs help to visualize designs in 3D, perform tests and simulations virtually prior to creation of any physical component, and consequently play a vital role in sustaining and maintaining Industry 4.0. It is anticipated that DTs will become prevalent in the foreseeable future because they can be used for configuration, monitoring, diagnostics, and prognostics. This article envisages how blockchain can reshape and transform DTs to bring about secure manufacturing that guarantees traceability, compliance, authenticity, quality, and safety. We discuss several benefits of employing blockchain in DTs. We taxonomize the DTs literature based on key parameters (e.g., DTs levels, design phases, industrial use cases, key objectives, enabling technologies, and core applications). We provide insights into ongoing progress made towards DTs by presenting recent synergies and case studies. Finally, we discuss open challenges that serve as future research directions.},

abstract = {Despite the rapid development of cloud computing for many years, data security and trusted computing are still the main challenges in current cloud computing applications. In order to solve this problem, many scholars have carried out a lot of research on this, and proposed many models including data integrity test and secure multi-party calculation. However, most of these solutions face problems such as excessive computational complexity or lack of scalability. This paper studies the use of blockchain techniques to improve this situation. Blockchain is a decentralized new distributed computing paradigm. Applying blockchain technology to cloud computing, using the security mechanism of the former to improve the performance of the latter's secure storage and secure computing is a promising research topic. In this paper, the distributed virtual machine agent model is deployed in the cloud by using mobile agent technology. The virtual machine agent enables multi-tenants to cooperate with each other to ensure data trust verification. The tasks of reliable data storage, monitoring and verification are completed by virtual machine agent mechanism. This is also a necessary condition for building a blockchain integrity protection mechanism. The blockchain-based integrity protection framework is built by the virtual machine proxy model, and the unique hash value corresponding to the file generated by the Merkel hash tree is used to monitor the data change by means of the smart contract on the blockchain, and the data is owned in time. The user issues a warning message for data tampering; in addition, a “block-and-response” mode is used to construct a blockchain-based cloud data integrity verification scheme.},

abstract = {With the fast development and expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT), billions of smart devices are being continuously connected, and smart homes, as a typical IoT application, are providing people with various convenient applications, but face security and privacy issues. The idea of Blockchain (BC) theory has brought about a potential solution to the IoT security problem. The emergence of blockchain technology has brought about a change of decentralized management, providing an effective solution for the protection of network security and privacy. On the other hand, the smart devices in IoT are always lightweight and have less energy and memory. This makes the application of blockchain difficult. Against this background, this paper proposes a blockchain model based on hypergraphs. The aims of this model are to reduce the storage consumption and to solve the additional security issues. In the model, we use the hyperedge as the organization of storage nodes and convert the entire networked data storage into part network storage. We discuss the design of the model and security strategy in detail, introducing some use cases in a smart home network and evaluating the storage performance of the model through simulation experiments and an evaluation of the network.},

Integrating IoT technology with blockchain can make FSC transparent, making it more productive by providing trustworthy and secure information to both consumers and relevant parties. This paper proposes an architecture of a blockchain- enabled IoT platform to replace the third party present in the FSC, which would authorize the product data. This platform will ensure that the product data collected through sensors from each stage of the supply chain is legitimate and adheres to terms agreed by all parties involved in the system. We present a case study to support the idea of accessible IoT technology being used to create a data network. It details which different technologies that can be used in IoT platform and how it supports the proposed architecture.

abstract = {With the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT), the number of IoT devices has increased exponentially. Therefore, we have put forward higher security requirements for the management, transmission, and storage of massive IoT data. However, during the transmission process of IoT data, security issues, such as data theft and forgery, are prone to occur. In addition, most existing data storage solutions are centralized, i.e., data are stored and maintained by a centralized server. Once the server is maliciously attacked, the security of IoT data will be greatly threatened. In view of the above-mentioned security issues, a security transmission and storage solution is proposed about sensing image for blockchain in the IoT. Firstly, this solution intelligently senses user image information, and divides these sensed data into intelligent blocks. Secondly, different blocks of data are encrypted and transmitted securely through intelligent encryption algorithms. Finally, signature verification and storage are performed through an intelligent verification algorithm. Compared with the traditional IoT data transmission and centralized storage solution, our solution combines the IoT with the blockchain, making use of the advantages of blockchain decentralization, high reliability, and low cost to transfer and store users image information securely. Security analysis proves that the solution can resist theft attacks and ensure the security of user image information during transmission and storage.},

However, this policy is considered to be less effective in solving logistical distribution chain problems which often caused the high price of basic goods in the market. Based on the results of the authors' observation, the process of dismantling containers at Indonesian ports can take more than 4 days. This is quite alarming, Indonesian port is the key to logistics distribution both between Indonesian islands and the international world, yet the condition. Therefore, the writing team formulated a concept of Indonesian “E-Toll Laut” (sea e-highway) policy as an e-governance solution to improve port management in Indonesia. E-Toll Laut itself is a name that the team of authors designates to explain the mechanism of blockchain port management in Indonesia. Based on the author's research team, this system is proven to be able to guarantee accountability, simplify the monitoring process, and accelerate bureaucratic processes and port transactions that are considered as accidents of the dwelling time process in Indonesia.

abstract = {The EPCglobal Network is a computer network used to share product data between trading partners. The EPC Information Services (EPCIS) is an event record repository that allows disparate applications to access and query for data both within and across enterprises. Ultimately, this data sharing is aimed at enabling participants in the EPCglobal Network to gain a shared view of the disposition of EPC-bearing objects within a relevant business context [1].Despite the potential benefits, enterprises are reluctant to integrate into the EPCglobal Network due to the financial and manpower resources required to set up, operate and maintain the EPCIS and to adopt the standards. Issues like security, computation and storage overheads would also have to be managed. To solve the problem, this paper advocates a blockchain solution using Hyperledger Fabric to serve as a shared EPCIS across trading partners. The blockchain can be queried directly to facilitate information sharing subjected to access control rules. It also adheres to the EPCglobal Network standards. This approach provides several important benefits including eliminating the need for enterprises to maintain their own EPCIS while still being able to participate and benefit from the network. As the blockchain can be queried directly, the provision of EPC Discovery Services (EPCDS) may also be unnecessary. To explore this idea, we constructed a prototype using Hyperledger Composer and Hyperledger Fabric while adhering to the data elements, structures and formats as stated in the standards to ensure interoperability with existing architecture both upstream and downstream.},

abstract = {Designing government independent and secure identification- and authentication protocols is a challenging task. Design flaws and missing specifications as well as security- and privacy issues of such protocols pose considerable user risks. Formal methods, such as Colored Petri Nets (CPN), are utilised for the design, development and analysis of such new protocols in order to detect flaws and mitigate identified security risks before deployment. This paper fills the gap, by applying in a novel way a set of security risk-oriented patterns (SRP) to the so-called Authcoin protocol that we formalise using CPN. The initial formal model of Authcoin facilitates the detection and elimination of design flaws, missing specifications as well as security- and privacy issues. The additional risk- and threat analysis based on the Information Systems Security Risk Management (ISSRM) domain model we perform on the formal CPN models of the protocol. The identified risks are mitigated by applying SRPs to the formal model of the Authcoin protocol. SRPs are a means to mitigate common security- and privacy risks in a business-process context by applying thoroughly tested and proven best-practice solutions. The goal of this work is to test the utility of SRPs outside of the the usual application domain, to reduce the risks and vulnerabilities of the Authcoin protocol.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

The system mainly includes three modules: Block storage, index storage and time-series data storage. The time-series database is used as the basic storage tool so it can fully utilize the corresponding feature such as elasticity, automation, efficiency, etc. By proper parameter configuration, the system can retain data within a certain time window, automatically clear expired blocks, free up storage space for dynamic growth, and provide data aggregation statistics that can be directly applied to data analysis systems.

abstract = {The dissemination of patients' medical records results in diverse risks to patients' privacy as malicious activities on these records cause severe damage to the reputation, finances, and so on of all parties related directly or indirectly to the data. Current methods to effectively manage and protect medical records have been proved to be insufficient. In this paper, we propose MeDShare, a system that addresses the issue of medical data sharing among medical big data custodians in a trust-less environment. The system is blockchain-based and provides data provenance, auditing, and control for shared medical data in cloud repositories among big data entities. MeDShare monitors entities that access data for malicious use from a data custodian system. In MeDShare, data transitions and sharing from one entity to the other, along with all actions performed on the MeDShare system, are recorded in a tamper-proof manner. The design employs smart contracts and an access control mechanism to effectively track the behavior of the data and revoke access to offending entities on detection of violation of permissions on data. The performance of MeDShare is comparable to current cutting edge solutions to data sharing among cloud service providers. By implementing MeDShare, cloud service providers and other data guardians will be able to achieve data provenance and auditing while sharing medical data with entities such as research and medical institutions with minimal risk to data privacy.},

Blockchain-based approaches provide decentralized security and privacy, yet they involve significant energy, delay, and computational overhead that is not suitable for most resource-constrained IoT devices. In our previous work, we presented a lightweight instantiation of a BC particularly geared for use in IoT by eliminating the Proof of Work (POW) and the concept of coins. Our approach was exemplified in a smart home setting and consists of three main tiers namely: cloud storage, overlay, and smart home. In this paper we delve deeper and outline the various core components and functions of the smart home tier. Each smart home is equipped with an always online, high resource device, known as 'miner' that is responsible for handling all communication within and external to the home. The miner also preserves a private and secure BC, used for controlling and auditing communications. We show that our proposed BC-based smart home framework is secure by thoroughly analysing its security with respect to the fundamental security goals of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Finally, we present simulation results to highlight that the overheads (in terms of traffic, processing time and energy consumption) introduced by our approach are insignificant relative to its security and privacy gains.},

abstract = {Due to increased number of attacks on the Internet of Things (IoT) devices, the security of IoT networks became critical. Some recent researches proposed the adoption of blockchain in IoT networks without a thorough discussion on the impact of the solution on the devices performance. Furthermore, blockchain employment in the context of IoT can be challenging due to the devices hardware limitations. To fill this gap, this paper proposes an IoT ledger-based architecture to ensure access control on heterogeneous scenarios. This research applies conventional devices used on IoT networks, such as Arduino, Raspberry and Orange Pi boards. Finally, we perform performance evaluation focused on access control of IoT devices and on information propagation through peers on a private IoT network scenario.},

Blockchain solutions are currently being proposed to address diverse problems in different domains. This paper presents a scoping review of the scientific literature to map the current research area of blockchain applications in the biomedical domain. The goal is to identify biomedical problems treated with blockchain technology, the level of maturity of respective approaches, types of biomedical data considered, blockchain features and functionalities exploited and blockchain technology frameworks used. The study follows the PRISMA-ScR methodology. Literature search was conducted on August 2018 and the systematic selection process identified 47 research articles for detailed study. Our findings show that the field is still in its infancy, with the majority of studies in the conceptual or architectural design phase; only one study reports real world demonstration and evaluation. Research is greatly focused on integration, integrity and access control of health records and related patient data. However, other diverse and interesting applications are emerging, addressing medical research, clinical trials, medicines supply chain, and medical insurance.},

Due to increased interest in renewable energy production and consumption, energy distribution using a centralized grid architecture has limited applicability. Blockchain technology has attained significant attention recently and provides a number of ways for reliable processing and storage of data in a decentralized manner. It is now recognized that trustless decentralized energy production and transfer using blockchain technology is a promising approach. This work proposes a novel blockchain-based decentralized green energy distribution system for trustless reliable energy exchanges in a smart grid. The proof of distribution problem in a decentralized environment is first formalized. The reliability and validity of the energy distribution system is established by way of a robustness evaluation model. An extensive experimental study is performed to evaluate the effectiveness and soundness of the solution. Finally, a decentralized green energy distribution smart-grid case study is presented to demonstrate the utility of the system in real-life situations.},

abstract = {The sharing of electronic health records (EHRs) has great positive significance for research of disease and doctors' diagnosis. In recent years, cloud-based electronic medical record sharing scheme has brought a lot of conveniences, but the centralization of cloud exposes threats inevitably to data security and privacy preservation. Blockchain technology can be seen as a promising solution to address these problems on account of its unique propertis of decentration, anonymity, unforgeability and verifiability. In this paper, we propose a blockchain based secure and privacy-preserving EHR sharing protocol. Data requester can search desired keyword from data provider to find relevant EHRs on the EHR consortium blockchain and get the re-encryption ciphertext from cloud server after getting the data owner's authorization. The scheme mainly uses searchable encryption and conditional proxy re-encryption to realize data security, privacy preservation, and access control. Furthermore, proof of authorization is designed as the consensus mechanism for consortium blockchain to guarantee system's availability. Security analysis demonstrates that the proposed protocol can achieve security goals. Besides, we emulate the cryptographic primitives and implement the proposed scheme on Ethereum platform. Performance evaluation shows that the proposed scheme has high computational efficiency.},

This paradigm change especially manifests itself among electrical system suppliers, as the electrical components transmit the vehicle's energy and communication flow, determining safety critical functions in the vehicle such as steering and braking. In this research, we conducted a multiple embedded case study in the electrical supplier industry in order to derive current challenges as well as future requirements for production processes of safety critical products in the age of autonomous driving. Our data suggest, that the established manufacturing process and practices are unable to fulfill the increasing need for digital continuity, transparency and documentation. To overcome those barriers, we propose a blockchain (BC) and Internet of Things (IoT) enabled traceability system. Through the application of BC, processes can be interconnected, tracked and audited, achieving higher security, liability and quality. This is the first paper, which investigates manufacturing of electrical systems for self-driving vehicles as a suitable use case for BC application.},

However, this is not the case for multi-administrative domains, e.g. among different enterprises. In such situation, new problems arise that challenge classical solutions such as PKIs, which suffer from scalability and granularity concerns. In this paper, we present an extension to Group-Based Policy - a widely used network policy language-for the aforementioned scenario. To do so, we take advantage of a permissioned blockchain implementation (Hyperledger Fabric) to distribute access control policies in a secure and auditable manner, preserving at the same time the independence of each organization. Network administrators specify polices that are rendered into blockchain transactions. A LISP control plane (RFC 6830) allows routers performing the access control to query the blockchain for authorizations. We have implemented an end-to-end experimental prototype and evaluated it in terms of scalability and network latency.},

abstract = {Personal health record system (PHR system) stores health-related information of an individual. PHR system allows the data owner to manage and share his/her data with selected individuals. The originality or tamper resistance feature is crucial for PHR system because of the irreversible consequence of incorrect information. Blockchain technology becomes a potential solution due to its immutability and irreversibility properties. Unfortunately, some technical impediments such as limited storage, privacy concern, consent irrevocability, inefficient performance, and energy consumption exist. This work aims to handle these blockchain drawbacks and propose a blockchain-based PHR model. The proposed model is built using the blockchain technology to support a tamper resistance feature. Proxy reencryption and other cryptographic techniques are employed to preserve privacy. Features of the proposed model include fine-grained and flexible access control, revocability of consent, auditability, and tamper resistance. A detailed security analysis shows that the proposed model is provably secure for privacy and tamper resistance. The performance analysis shows that the proposed model achieves a better overall performance compared with the existing approach in the literature. Thus the proposed model is more suitable for the PHR system usage.},

abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to demonstrate the utility of a target-centric approach to intelligence collection and analysis in the prevention and investigation of ransomware attacks that involve cryptocurrencies. The paper uses the May 2017 WannaCry ransomware usage of the Bitcoin ecosystem as a case study. The approach proves particularly beneficial in facilitating information sharing and an integrated analysis across intelligence domains. Design/methodology/approach: This study conducted data collection and analysis of the component Bitcoin elements of the WannaCry ransomware attack. A note of both technicalities of Bitcoin operations and current models for sharing cyber intelligence was made. Our analysis builds on and further develops current definitions and strategies for sharing cyber threat intelligence. It uses the problem definition model (PDM) and generic target network model (TNM) to create an analytic framework for the WannaCry ransomware attack scenario, allowing analysts the ability to test their hypotheses and integrate and share data for collaborative investigation. Findings: Using a target-centric intelligence approach to WannaCry 2.0 shows that it is possible to model the intelligence problem of collecting and analysing data related to inflows and outflows of Bitcoin-related ransomware transactions. Bitcoin transactions form graph networks and allow to build a target network model for collecting, analysing and sharing intelligence with multiple stakeholders. Although attribution and anonymity prevail under cryptocurrency usage, there is a means for developing transaction walks using this method to target nefarious cryptocurrency exchanges where criminals are inclined to cash out their proceeds of crime. Originality/value: The application of a target-centric intelligence approach to the cryptocurrency components of a ransomware attack provides a framework for intelligence units to break down the problem in the financial domain and model the network behaviour of illicit Bitcoin transactions relating to ransomware.},

In order to enhance the detection capability of a single IDS, collaborative intrusion detection networks (or collaborative IDSs) have been developed, which allow IDS nodes to exchange data with each other. However, data and trust management still remain two challenges for current detection architectures, which may degrade the effectiveness of such detection systems. In recent years, blockchain technology has shown its adaptability in many fields, such as supply chain management, international payment, interbanking, and so on. As blockchain can protect the integrity of data storage and ensure process transparency, it has a potential to be applied to intrusion detection domain. Motivated by this, this paper provides a review regarding the intersection of IDSs and blockchains. In particular, we introduce the background of intrusion detection and blockchain, discuss the applicability of blockchain to intrusion detection, and identify open challenges in this direction.},

Blockchain, as a distributed public ledger technology, has been widely adopted in the design of new energy trading schemes. However, there are many challenging issues in blockchain-based energy trading, e.g., low efficiency, high transaction cost, and security and privacy issues. To tackle these challenges, many solutions have been proposed. In this survey, the blockchain-based energy trading in the electrical power system is thoroughly investigated. Firstly, the challenges in blockchain-based energy trading are identified and summarized. Then, the existing energy trading schemes are studied and classified into three categories based on their main focuses: energy transaction, consensus mechanism, and system optimization. Blockchain-based energy trading has been a popular research topic, new blockchain architectures, models and products are continually emerging to overcome the limitations of existing solutions, forming a virtuous circle. The internal combination of different blockchain types and the combination of blockchain with other technologies improve the blockchain-based energy trading system to better satisfy the practical requirements of modern power systems. However, there are still some problems to be solved, for example, the lack of regulatory system, environmental challenges and so on. In the future, we will strive for a better optimized structure and establish a comprehensive security assessment model for blockchain-based energy trading system.},

abstract = {Purpose: Nowadays, to operate securely and legally and to achieve business objectives, secure valuable assets and support uninterrupted business processes, all organizations need to match a lot of internal and external compliance regulations such as laws, standards, guidelines, policies, specifications and procedures. An integrated system able to manage information security (IS) for their intranets in the new cyberspace while processing tremendous amounts of IS-related data coming in various formats is required as never before. These data, after being collected and analyzed, should be evaluated in real-time from an IS incident viewpoint, to identify an incident's source, consider its type, weigh its consequences, visualize its vector, associate all target systems, prioritize countermeasures and offer mitigation solutions with weighted impact relevance. Different security information and event management (SIEM) systems cope with this routine and usually complicated work by rapid detection of IS incidents and further appropriate response. Modern challenges dictate the need to build these systems using advanced technologies such as the blockchain (BC) technologies (BCTs). The purpose of this study is to design a new BC-based SIEM 3.0 system and propose a methodology for its evaluation. Design/methodology/approach: Modern challenges dictate the need to build these systems using advanced technologies such as the BC technologies. Many internet resources argue that the BCT suits the intrusion detection objectives very well, but they do not mention how to implement it. Findings: After a brief analysis of the BC concept and the evolution of SIEM systems, this paper presents the main ideas on designing the next-generation BC-based SIEM 3.0 systems, for the first time in open access publications, including a convolution method for solving the scalability issue for ever-growing BC size. This new approach makes it possible not to simply modify SIEM systems in an evolutionary manner, but to bring their next generation to a qualitatively new and higher level of IS event management in the future. Research limitations/implications: The most important area of the future work is to bring this proposed system to life. The implementation, deployment and testing onto a real-world network would also allow people to see its viability or show that a more sophisticated model should be worked out. After developing the design basics, we are ready to determine the directions of the most promising studies. What are the main criteria and principles, according to which the organization will select events from PEL for creating one BC block? What is the optimal number of nodes in the organization's BC, depending on its network assets, services provided and the number of events that occur in its network? How to build and host the SIEM 3.0 BC infrastructure? How to arrange streaming analytics of block's content containing events taking place in the network? How to design the BC middleware as software that enables staff to interact with BC blocks to provide services like IS events correlation? How to visualize the results obtained to find insights and patterns in historical BC data for better IS management? How to predict the emergence of IS events in the future? This list of questions can be continued indefinitely for a full-fledged design of SIEM 3.0. Practical implications: This paper shows the full applicability of the BC concept to the creation of the next-generation SIEM 3.0 systems that are designed to detect IS incidents in a modern, fully interconnected organization's network environment. The authors' attempt to begin with a detailed description of the basics for a BC-based SIEM 3.0 system design is presented, as well as the evaluation methodology for the resulting product. Originality/value: The authors believe that their new revolutionary approach makes it possible not to simply modify SIEM systems in an evolutionary manner, but to bring their next generation to a qualitatively new and higher level of IS event management in the future. They hope that this paper will evoke a lively response in this segment of the security controls market from both theorists and direct developers of living systems that will implement the above approach.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

The ability to electronically regulate data sharing within and across different organizational entities in the supply chain (SC) is an open issue that is only addressed partially by existing legal and regulatory compliance frameworks.

Cydon utilizes a smart distributed ledger to offer an immutable audit trail and transaction history for all different levels of data access and modification within a SC and for all data flows within the environment. Results suggest that Cydon provides authorized and fast access to secure distributed data, avoids single points of failure by securely distributing encrypted data across different nodes while maintains an &#x201C;always-on&#x201D; chain of custody.},

These technologies facilitate the simplification of processes and provide secure management of recorded data, guaranteeing the transmission and public transparency of information. Based on the combination of a Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) platform and G-Cloud solutions, our proposal consists of the design of an e-Participation model that uses a tokenizable system of the actions and processes undertaken by citizens in participatory processes providing incentives to promote greater participation in public affairs. In order to develop a sustainable, scalable and resilient e-Participation system, a new blockchain concept, which organizes the blocks as a neural system, is combined with the implementation of a virtual token to reward participants. Furthermore, this virtual token is deployed through a smart contract that the block itself produces, containing information about the transaction and all the documents involved in the process. Finally, our Neural Distributed Ledger (NDL) framework facilitates the interconnection of blockchain networks in a transparent, certified, secure, auditable, scalable and traceable way.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has already reshaped and transformed our lives in many ways, ranging from how we communicate with people or manage our health to how we drive our cars and manage our homes. With the rapid development of the IoT ecosystem in a wide range of applications, IoT devices and data are going to be traded as commodities in the marketplace in the near future, similar to cloud services or physical objects. Developing such a trading platform has previously been identified as one of the key grand challenges in the integration of IoT and data science. Deployment of such a platform raises concerns about the security and privacy of data and devices since their ownership is hard to trace and manage without a central trusted authority. A central trusted authority is not a viable solution for a fully decentralized and distributed IoT ecosystem with a large number of distributed device vendors and consumers. Blockchain, as a decentralized system, removes the requirement for a trusted third-party by allowing participants to verify data correctness and ensure its immutability. IoT devices can use blockchain to register themselves and organize, store, and share streams of data effectively and reliably. We demonstrate the applicability of blockchain to IoT devices and data management with an aim of providing end-to-end trust for trading. We also give a brief introduction to the topics and challenges for future research toward developing a trustworthy trading platform for IoT ecosystems.},

This paper proposes a blockchain based IoT security solution where, trust is established through the immutable and decentralized nature of blockchain. The distributed nature of blockchain makes the system more robust and immune to single point of failure. We propose a mechanism to establish continuous security in the system by evaluating legitimate presence of user in valid IoT-Zone continuously without user intervention. Every user interaction in an IoT environment is stored in blockchain as a transaction and series of these transactions represent a user's IoT-trail. A unique digital crypto-token is required for a user interaction to be legitimate. This token is used as an access control mechanism to prevent any unauthorized access to the system. Tokens are pre-generated using a prediction model based on user's IoT-trail in the blockchain. By using blockchain as an underlying framework in IoT environment and through the method of continuous security, we made the system more secure, robust and interoperable.},

Industry 4.0 (I4.0) extends further the IIoT model with the inclusion of robotics and automation, whereas Hospital 4.0 (H4.0) is the application of the I4.0 paradigm to the healthcare sector. H4.0 relies on cyber-physical systems managing several devices and software components. and the exchange of a huge amount of sensible data that includes medical records. Medical records can be much more valuable to criminals than financial data, indeed the control of medical data allows criminals to plan and realize different frauds, that the victims may identify only too late. Furthermore, the complexity of a typical H4.0 cyber-physical system makes healthcare records particularly vulnerable. Blockchain is today an emerging technology for the management of data that may avoid or mitigate the impact of threats related to data storage and management, in general, and to the administration, in particular, of healthcare records. The blockchain technology relies on cryptography and distributed consensus to guarantee data integrity, accountability and security. The exploitation of such technology is considered in this chapter, showing the advantages when used in a H4.0 scenario.},

abstract = {Software defined networking (SDN) is one of the most popular network technologies which provides an adaptive, agile and flexible network management and visibility. Although SDN architecture provides manifold benefits but on the same time its dependence on a logically centralized controller lead to the single point of failure. An attacker can easily capture the any forwarding device and restrict the availability of the controller using different prevalent attacks. Distributed denial of service (DDoS) is one of the most popular attack of this category which is quiet prevalent in SDN. Here, the aim of the attackers is to inject false script in the open flow tables through malicious switches which multiply exponentially. Therefore, in this paper, a blockchain as a service framework has been presented wherein BlockSDSec model is designed to provide security as a separate service for the SDN architecture. This work provides a mechanism to prevent the threats of DDoS at the switch level by embedding an security using blockchain onto the interaction channels of data and control planes. The load balancing at the controller level is achieved using a virtual controller. The proposed scheme is simulated using MiniNet Emulator to analyze the delay originating from usage of blockchain.},

However, an open issue that slows the adoption of blockchain technology in the energy sector is the low scalability and high processing overhead when dealing with the real-time energy data collected by smart energy meters. Thus, in this paper, we propose a scalable second tier solution which combines the blockchain ledger with distributed queuing systems and NoSQL (Not Only SQL database) databases to allow the registration of energy transactions less frequently on the chain without losing the tamper-evident benefits brought by the blockchain technology. At the same time, we propose a technique for tamper-evident registration of smart meters' energy data and associated energy transactions using digital fingerprinting which allows the energy transaction to be linked hashed-back on-chain, while the sensors data is stored off-chain. A prototype was implemented using Ethereum and smart contracts for the on-chain components while for the off-chain components we used Cassandra database and RabbitMQ messaging broker. The prototype proved to be effective in managing a settlement of energy imbalances use-case and during the evaluation conducted in simulated environment shows promising results in terms of scalability, throughput, and tampering of energy data sampled by smart energy meters.},

abstract = {The concept of functional encryption (FE) has been introduced to address the shortcomings of public-key encryption (PKE) in many emerging applications which require both data storage and data sharing (e.g., cloud storage service). One of the major issues existing in most FE schemes is the efficiency, as they are built from bilinear pairings of which the computation is very expensive. A widely accepted solution to this problem is outsourcing the heavy workloads to a powerful third party and leaving the user with the light computation. Nevertheless, it is impractical to assume that the third party (e.g., the cloud) will provide free services. To our knowledge, no attention has been paid to the payment procedure between the user and the third party in an FE with outsourced decryption (FEOD) scheme under the assumption that neither of them should be trusted. Leveraging the transactions on cryptocurrencies supported by the blockchain technology, in this paper, we aim to design FE with payable outsourced decryption (FEPOD) schemes. The payment in an FEPOD scheme is achieved through a blockchain-based cryptocurrency, which enables the user to pay a third party when it correctly completes the outsourced decryption. We define the adversarial model for FEPOD schemes, and then present a generic construction of FEPOD schemes. Also, we evaluate the performance of the proposed generic construction by implementing a concrete FEPOD scheme over a blockchain platform.},

abstract = {This paper tackles the issue of data siloing, where organisations are unable to share data with each other because of privacy concerns. Machine Learning models, which could benefit greatly from larger data sets shared between organisations, suffer in this era of data isolation. To solve this problem, a blockchain based implementation is proposed that allows training of machine learning models in a privacy compliant way. Instead of using blockchain in a typical database-style manner, the proposed solution uses blockchain as a means to handle joint ownership and joint control over a computer system known as the Training Machine. The Training Machine, set-up jointly by consortium members, serves as a secure, independent container that accepts data sets and an untrained model as inputs from different entities, trains the model internally, and outputs the trained model without revealing any data to other entities. Data is then deleted automatically. Blockchain ensures that this machine is not under the control of any one entity but is rather controlled transparently by all data-sharing parties. By placing sensitive information in an isolated system, and establishing blockchain based access control, the solution ensures that data is not accessible to any party other than the owner. The paper also shares use cases of this technology, along with a risk analysis and proof of concept.},

Building upon the idea of using blockchain as the underlying technology to enable tracing transactions for service contracts and dispute arbitration, this paper proposes a novel consensus protocol that is suitable for the crowdsourcing as well as the general online service industry. The new consensus protocol is called Proof-of-Trust (PoT) consensus; it selects transaction validators based on the service participants' trust values while leveraging RAFT leader election and Shamir's secret sharing algorithms. The PoT protocol avoids the low throughput and resource intensive pitfalls associated with Bitcoin' s Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining, while addressing the scalability issue associated with the traditional Paxos-based and Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)-based algorithms. In addition, it addresses the unfaithful behaviors that cannot be dealt with in the traditional BFT algorithms. The paper demonstrates that our approach can provide a viable accountability solution for the online service industry.},

abstract = {Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) is a modular and extensible permissioned blockchain platform released to open-source and hosted by the Linux Foundation. The platform's design exhibits principles required by enterprise grade business applications like supply-chains, nancial transactions, asset management, food safety, and many more. For that end HLF introduces several innovations, two of which are smart contracts in general purpose languages (chaincode in HLF), and exible endorsement policies, which govern whether a transaction is considered valid. Typical blockchain applications are comprised of two tiers: the rst tier focuses on the modelling of the data schema and embedding of business rules into the blockchain by means of smart contracts (chaincode) and endorsment policies; and the second tier uses the SDK (Software Development Kit) provided by HLF to implement client side application logic. However there is a gap between the two tiers that hinders the rapid adoption of changes in the chaincode and endorsement policies within the client SDK. Currently, the chaincode location and endorsement policies are statically congured into the client SDK. This limits the reliability and availability of the client in the event of changes in the platform, and makes the platform more dicult to use. In this work we address and bridge the gap by describing the design and implementation of Service Discovery. Service Discovery provides APIs which allow dynamic discovery of the conguration required for the client SDK to interact with the platform, alleviating the client from the burden of maintaining it. This enables the client to rapidly adapt to changes in the platform, thus signicantly improving the reliability of the application layer. It also makes the HLF platform more consumable, simplifying the job of creating blockchain applications.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Blockchains have been proposed as a promising solution for supporting Electronic Health Records (EHRs), but have also been linked to scalability concerns about supporting real-world healthcare systems. This paper quantifies the scalability issues and bottlenecks related to current blockchains and puts into perspective the limitations blockchains have with supporting healthcare systems. Particularly we show that well known blockchains such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and IOTA cannot support transactions of a large scale hospital system such as the University of Kentucky HealthCare system and leave over 7.5M unsealed transactions per day. We then discuss how bottlenecks of blockchains can be relieved with sidechains, enabling well-known blockchains to support even larger hospital systems of over 30M transactions per day. We then introduce the Patient-Healthchain architecture to provide future direction on how scaling blockchains for EHR systems with sidechains can be achieved.},

However, BCs are computationally expensive and involve high bandwidth overhead and delays, which are not suitable for most IoT devices. This paper proposes a lightweight BC-based architecture for IoT that virtually eliminates the overheads of classic BC, while maintaining most of its security and privacy benefits. IoT devices benefit from a private immutable ledger, that acts similar to BC but is managed centrally, to optimize energy consumption. High resource devices create an overlay network to implement a publicly accessible distributed BC that ensures end-to-end security and privacy. The proposed architecture uses distributed trust to reduce the block validation processing time. We explore our approach in a smart home seeing as a representative case study for broader IoT applications. Thalitative evaluation of the architecture under common threat models highlights its effectiveness in providing security and privacy for IoT applications. Simulations demonstrate that our method decreases packet and processing overhead significantly compared to the BC implementation used in Bitcoin.},

Blockchain has emerged as an effective solution for addressing several such challenges. However, the basic algorithms used in the business blockchain are not feasible for large scale IoT systems. To make them scalable for IoT, the complex consensus-based security has to be downgraded.

Technology has helped supply chain distribution to be successful and more competitive in the global market by improving their customers satisfaction level and providing more reasonable prices compared to their competitors. However, nowadays supply chains are long and complex and include many different actors, beginning with the farmers, followed by collectors, traders, manufacturers. At the end, the processed products are difficult to trace back to their origins in a trusted way. Best way so far is the continuous medial or legal documentation of the chain of transactions, available only to a limited circle of persons. The recent efforts toward blockchain-based trust management open a new perspective here. Here, we propose a solution to link legal documentation and blockchain technology within a traceability system, with the specific application case of cacao and chocolate production in mind. For improved data security, the common blockchain concept is extended to a two-factor blockchain, where both blockchains are connected via digital watermarking of the documentation media, one blockchain traces the documentation steps, the other the watermarking embedding. By a unique reading-verification approach, the integrity of their relatedness can be proven, thus improving also reliability of the whole product tracing.},

Thus, the use of technological solutions has been widely adopted in the medical field to improve the patients' health. In this context, approaches based on Cloud Computing have been used to store and process the information generated in these solutions. However, using Cloud can create delays that are intolerable for medical applications. Thus, the Fog Computing paradigm emerged as an alternative to overcome this problem, bringing computation and storage closer to the data sources. However, managing medical data stored in Fog is still a challenge. Moreover, characteristics of availability, performance, interoperability, and privacy need to be considered in approaches that aim to explore this problem. So, this article shows a software architecture based on Fog Computing and designed to facilitate the management of medical records. This architecture uses Blockchain concepts to provide the necessary privacy features and to allow Fog Nodes to carry out the authorization process in a distributed way. Finally, this paper describes a case study that evaluates the performance, privacy, and interoperability requirements of the proposed architecture in a home-centered healthcare scenario.},

abstract = {The peer-to-peer energy trading has been achieved among nodes in industrial Internet of Things. To establish a secure private market, some meaningful works propose the concept of the energy chain, where one block is added in a linear and chronological order once the trading pair of nodes (buyer and seller) has a valid transaction verified by data audit (e.g., a hash value). Since the buyer applies virtual coins from the credit bank to buy others' surplus energy, a considerable credit utility is obtained if all nodes are encouraged to meet local power loads out of self-interest. However, such frequent transactions have huge operational overhead, including a long chain maintaining many blocks and an expensive energy transportation cost between trading pairs. To solve these challenging issues, our method enables nodes to satisfy their power loads through local stored energy (self-sufficiency), before participating as sellers if they still have considerable surplus electricity. Without transactions made by some self-sufficient nodes, the operational overhead can be mitigated in a more secure environment. Taking the classic Internet of energy as a case study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our solutions, and it can achieve a good tradeoff between credit utility and operational overhead.},

We propose a novel identity and access management system for cloud federations. The system allows federated organizations to enforce attribute-based access control policies on their data in a privacy-preserving fashion. Users are granted access to federated data when their identity attributes match the policies, but without revealing their attributes to the federated organization owning data. The system also guarantees the integrity of the policy evaluation process by using block chain technology and Intel SGX trusted hardware. It uses block chain to ensure that users identity attributes and access control policies cannot be modified by a malicious user, while Intel SGX protects the integrity and confidentiality of the policy enforcement process. We present the access control protocol, the system architecture and discuss future extensions.},

@article{Samuel_2020,
abstract = {The International Energy Agency has projected that the total energy demand for electricity in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is expected to rise by an average of 4% per year up to 2040. It implies that $\sim$620 million people are living without electricity in SSA. Going with the 2030 vision of the United Nations that electricity should be accessible to all, it is important that new technology and methods are provided. In comparison to other nations worldwide, smart grid (SG) is an emerging technology in SSA. SG is an information technology-enhanced power grid, which provides a two-way communication network between energy producers and customers. Also, it includes renewable energy, smart meters, and smart devices that help to manage energy demands and reduce energy generation costs. However, SG is facing inherent difficulties, such as energy theft, lack of trust, security, and privacy issues. Therefore, this paper proposes a blockchain-based decentralized energy system (BDES) to accelerate rural and urban electrification by improving service delivery while minimizing the cost of generation and addressing historical antipathy and cybersecurity risk within SSA. Additionally, energy insufficiency and fixed pricing schemes may raise concerns in SG, such as the imbalance of order. The paper also introduces a blockchain-based energy trading system, which includes price negotiation and incentive mechanisms to address the imbalance of order. Moreover, existing models for energy planning do not consider the effect of fill rate (FR) and service level (SL). A blockchain levelized cost of energy (BLCOE) is proposed as the least-cost solution that measures the impact of energy reliability on generation cost using FR and SL. Simulation results are presented to show the performance of the proposed model and the least-cost option varies with relative energy generation cost of centralized, decentralized and BDES infrastructure. Case studies of Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Gambia, Liberia, Mali, and Senegal illustrate situations that are more suitable for BDES. For other SSA countries, BDES can cost-effectively service a large population and regions. Additionally, BLCOE reduces energy costs by approximately 95% for battery and 75% for the solar modules. The future BLCOE varies across SSA on an average of about 0.049 $/kWh as compared to 0.15 $/kWh of an existing system in the literature.},

Most of existing distributed parallel algorithms for inference based on OWL Horst ruleset require multiple iterations. Moreover, in the process of which, the data stored repeatedly generate redundant records, resulting the reasoning in low overall efficiency. In order to address the challenges, firstly, we presents a storage solution combining variable storage and multivariable connector in accordance with characteristics of OWL Horst ruleset in the context of knowledge graph, aiming at reduction of repeated data storage and data transmission cost. Then, on the basis of such scheme, a streaming reasoning algorithm is introduced to curtail iterations and promote efficiency. Experimental results on LUBM and DBpedia datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework and algorithm could deliver superior performance in scalability and efficiency.},

abstract = {Cloud storage enables users to upload, store and download their data. However, with the rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) and edge devices, such as camera, the cloud not only manages the user generate data but also devices generated data. This increment in the volume of outsourced data has raised two important issues in big data management for cloud storage servers, namely, optimal data storage and data security. In order to solve the former issue, cloud storage employs a deduplication technique to avoids storing duplicate data; and uses encryption to solve the later issue. However, both these issues are orthogonal in nature. Thanks to convergent encryption that addresses both the issues simultaneously. Nevertheless, the existing approaches relies on proxy servers and put all the trust on third party, which is vulnerable to single point failure. In this paper, we propose a novel lightweight decentralized encrypted cloud storage architecture called, Yugula, which maintains file confidentiality, removes the centralized data deduplication and increases file integrity by using blockchain. In particular, we discuss two approaches for file confidentiality with data deduplication: one uses double hashing and the other symmetric encryption. In order to show the efficiency and usability, we implemented the proposed architecture and showed its results in terms of high transaction throughput requirement for IoT data management in cloud storage.},

However, to execute collaborative business processes, we need a mechanism for enabling entire workflows as a whole, where participants' private processes must agree on the shared inter-organizational processes realized by Blockchain. To address this, we introduce a set of techniques that take business process models as input and transforms them into statecharts for Blockchain and process participants. We also optimize the size of the statechart in order to reduce the number of communications between Blockchain and participants. The statecharts are then used as a basis for generating software artifacts: smart contracts running on Blockchain and Web applications for process participants. Through the evaluation of our solution, we confirmed that our algorithms produce software artifacts that collaboratively work together. By applying the statechart reduction algorithms, we could reduce the number of sending and receiving events by 74% and 65% in two case studies.},

Many attempts have been made to overcome various limitations of blockchain for P2P games, but many of them require modifying the game itself to be compatible with a blockchain solution.

Unlike Bit coin, transactions in our system are not strictly financial - they are used to carry instructions, such as storing, querying and sharing data.

abstract = {Many applications by design depend on costly trusted third-party auditors. One such example is the industrial application case of federated multi-disciplinary optimization (MDO), in which different organizations contribute to a complex engineering design effort. Although blockchain and distributed ledger technology (DLT) has strong potential in reducing the dependence on such intermediaries, the architectural complexity involved in designing a solution is daunting. In this paper, we analyze the architectural variants for decentralized private data sharing while guaranteeing auditability and non-repudiation of data access operations, as well availability of the shared data. The architectural variants analyzed focus on attaining: (i) confidential data exchange, (ii) governing access to the shared data, (iii) providing data access auditability, and (iv) data validation or conflict resolution. We systematically enumerate architectural decisions at the levels of: storage, policy-based file access control, data encryption methods, and auditability mechanisms for private data. The main contribution of this work is a comprehensive overview of architectural variants for decentralized control of private encrypted data, and the involved trade-offs in terms of performance, storage overhead, auditable trust and security. These findings are validated in the context of the aforementioned industry case that involves federated multi-disciplinary optimization (MDO).},

The decentralization feature of blockchain is helpful to solve the problem that the secure authentication process is highly dependent on the trusted third party and implement data security transmission. In this paper, the blockchain technology is used to describe the security requirements in authentication process. A network model of MCPS based on blockchain is proposed. Through analysis of medical data storage architecture, data was ensured not to be tampered and trackable. The security threat was eliminated by bilinear mapping in the authentication process of medical data providers and users. The credibility problem of the trusted third party was avoided and the two-way authentication was realized between the hospital and blockchain node. The security analysis and performance test were carried out to verify the security and related performance of the authentication protocol. The results show that the MCPS based on blockchain realizes medical treatment data sharing, and meets safety requirements in the security authentication phase.},

Compared with Blockchain as a Service (BaaS), FBaaS has a lighter implementation of top-level business logics, which brings a number of advantages. Firstly, it could improve the operation speed of a blockchain. Secondly, the continuous advances in high robustness, high availability of the underlying FaaS network can be naturally adapted to the FBaaS because of its hierarchical architecture. Thirdly, FaaS implements higher level of abstraction of the logics that is much succinct. Moreover, this paper proposes an abstraction method in the realization of a business logic of consortium blockchain that could further improve the performance.

abstract = {Machine Learning systems rely on data for training, input and ongoing feedback and validation. Data in the field can come from varied sources, often anonymous or unknown to the ultimate users of the data. Whenever data is sourced and used, its consumers need assurance that the data accuracy is as described, that the data has been obtained legitimately, and they need to understand the terms under which the data is made available so that they can honour them. Similarly, suppliers of data require assurances that their data is being used legitimately by authorised parties, in accordance with their terms, and that usage is appropriately recompensed. Furthermore, both parties may want to agree on a specific set of quality of service (QoS) metrics, which can be used to negotiate service quality based on cost, and then receive affirmation that data is being supplied within those agreed QoS levels. Here we present a conceptual architecture which enables data sharing agreements to be encoded and computationally enforced, remuneration to be made when required, and a trusted audit trail to be produced for later analysis or reproduction of the environment. Our architecture uses blockchain-based distributed ledger technology, which can facilitate transactions in situations where parties do not have an established trust relationship or centralised command and control structures. We explore techniques to promote faith in the accuracy of the supplied data, and to let data users determine trade-offs between data quality and cost. Our system is exemplified through consideration of a case study using multiple data sources from different parties to monitor traffic levels in urban locations.},

The connected vehicles are experiencing prenominal growth in the auto industry, but are still studded with many security and privacy vulnerabilities. Today's IoV applications are part of cyber physical communication systems that collect useful information from thousands of smart sensors associated with the connected vehicles. The technology advancement has paved the way for connected vehicles to share significant information among drivers, auto manufacturers, auto insurance companies and operational and maintenance service providers for various applications. The critical issues in engineering the IoV applications are effective to use of the available spectrum and effective allocation of good channels an opportunistic manner to establish connectivity among vehicles, and the effective utilization of the infrastructure under various traffic conditions. Security and privacy in information sharing are the main concerns in a connected vehicle communication network. Blockchain technology facilitates secured communication among users in a connected vehicles network. Originally, blockchain technology was developed and employed with the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin, to provide increased trust, reliability, and security among users based on peer-to-peer networks for transaction sharing. In this paper, we propose to integrate blockchain technology into ad hoc vehicular networking so that the vehicles can share network resources with increased trust, reliability, and security using distributed access control system and can benefit a wider scope of scalable IoV applications scenarios for decision making. The proposed architecture is the faithful environment for information sharing among connected vehicles. Blockchain technology allows multiple copies of data storage at the distribution cloud. Distributed access control system is significantly more secure than a traditional centralized system. This paper also describes how important of ad hoc vehicular networking in human life, possibilities in real-world implementation and its future trends. The ad hoc vehicular networking may become one of the most trendy networking concepts in the future that has the perspective to bring out much ease human beneficial and secured applications.},

Existing IoT systems generally adopt lightweight security protocols that lead to compromise and privacy leakage. Edge computing enables better access control and privacy protection, furthermore, blockchain architecture has achieved a trusted store of value by open-source and distributed consensus mechanisms. To embrace these new paradigms, we propose a scheme that employs one-time association multitasking proofs for peer to local authentication (OTMP-P2L). The scheme chooses relevant nondeterministic polynomial (NP) problem tasks, and manages localized trust and anonymity by using smart devices such as phones and pads, thereby enabling IoT devices to autonomously perform consensus validation with an enhanced message authentication code. This nested code is a one-time zero-knowledge proof that comprises multiple logic verification arguments. To increase diversity and reduce the workload of each one, these arguments are chained by a method that establishes some of the inputs of the following task from the output of previous tasks. We implemented a smart lock system and confirmed that the scheme outperforms IoT authentication methods. The result demonstrates superior flexibility through dynamic difficulty strategies and succinct non-interactive peer-to-peer (P2P) verification.},

This results in reduction of time and cost for complex contract execution. Some contract execution require external information outside Blockchain as a trigger to execute the code specifying process for a certain contract. However, because Blockchain technology itself does not provide a function to directly access such external information, these applications require a proxy system called 'oracle'. Oracle is in charge accessing external information, to verify it, and to write it on Blockchain. To avoid security incidents such as oracle writing malicious information on Blockchain, reliability of oracle must be required. This paper introduces a decentralized oracle equipping with verification and disputation mechanisms. To evaluate reliability of the proposed mechanisms, a simulation-based experiment was conducted. The experimental results showed that our solution could effectively suppress the interference of malicious participants and obtained reliable consensus results even if relatively many malicious participants joined in the consensus process on the proposed decentralized oracle.},

Blockchain technology can significantly automate the software export auditing and tracking processes. It allows to track and control what data or software components are shared between entities across multiple security domains. Our blockchain-based solution relies on role-based and attribute-based access control and prevents unauthorized data accesses. It guarantees integrity of provenance data on who updated what software module and when. Furthermore, our solution detects data leakages, made behind the scene by authorized blockchain network participants, to unauthorized entities. Our approach is used for data forensics/provenance, when the identity of those entities who have accessed/ updated/ transferred the sensitive cyber data or sensitive software is determined. All the transactions in the global collaborative software development environment are recorded in the blockchain public ledger and can be verified any time in the future. Transactions can not be repudiated by invokers. We also propose modified transaction validation procedure to improve performance and to protect permissioned IBM Hyperledger-based blockchains from DoS attacks, caused by bursts of invalid transactions.},

In fact, there are various attacks targeting a range of vulnerabilities on vital elements of this paradigm such as controller, Northbound and Southbound interfaces. In addition to solutions of security enhancement, it is important to build mechanisms for digital forensics in SDN which provide the ability to investigate and evaluate the security of the whole network system. It should provide features of identifying, collecting and analyzing log files and detailed information about network devices and their traffic. However, upon penetrating a machine or device, hackers can edit, even delete log files to remove the evidences about their presence and actions in the system. In this case, securing log files with fine-grained access control in proper storage without any modification plays a crucial role in digital forensics and cybersecurity. This work proposes a blockchain-based approach to improve the security of log management in SDN for network forensics, called SDNLog-Foren. This model is also evaluated with different experiments to prove that it can help organizations keep sensitive log data of their network system in a secure way regardless of being compromised at some different components of SDN.},

Therefore, the main aim of this paper is to present a distributed peer to peer network architecture that improves the security and scalability of the CMfg. The proposed architecture was developed based on blockchain technology, this facilitated the development of a distributed peer to peer network with high security, scalability and a well-structured cloud system. The proposed architecture which was named as the “BCmfg” is made up of five layers namely; resource layer, perception layer, manufacturing layer, infrastructure layer and application layer. In this paper, the concept of its architecture, secure data sharing, and typical characteristic are discussed and investigated as well as the key technologies required for the implementation of this proposed architecture is explained based on demonstrative case study. The proposed architecture is explained based on a case study which contains five service providers and 15 end users with considering 32 OnCloud services. For evaluation purpose, the qualitative and quantitative methods are utilized and the results show that the proposed methodology can bring more advantages to CMfg than the security and scalability.},

abstract = {The management of energy supply and demand is becoming more challenging, especially in regions where the demand continues to grow rapidly and more intermittent renewable supply sources are added to the energy infrastructure. In this context, Demand Side Management (DSM) can be employed to align supply and demand and improve reliability of the system under supply constraints and stretch the capacity limits of the existing grid infrastructure. A game theoretic approach for a DSM model incorporating storage components is suggested in this paper especially for environments with energy supply constraints. The proposed model is able to not only reduce the Peak-to-Average ratio to benefit the electrical grid, but can also smoothen the dips in the load profile caused by supply constraints. In a case study to demonstrate the value of the model presented, a variety of residential demand types are evaluated within a micro-grid to maximize the payoff utility of both individual users and the whole system. Moreover, emerging blockchain technologies are introduced to guarantee the seamless and secure implementation of the proposed scheme, illustrating how a decentralized demand side management approach could be implemented in practice to facilitate peer-to-peer transactions following optimized demand profiles.},

abstract = {Internet of Things and data sciences are fueling the development of innovative solutions for various applications in Smart and Connected Communities (SCC). These applications provide participants with the capability to exchange not only data but also resources, which raises the concerns of integrity, trust, and above all the need for fair and optimal solutions to the problem of resource allocation. This exchange of information and resources leads to a problem where the stakeholders of the system may have limited trust in each other. Thus, collaboratively reaching consensus on when, how, and who should access certain resources becomes problematic. This paper presents SolidWorx, a blockchain-based platform that provides key mechanisms required for arbitrating resource consumption across different SCC applications in a domain-Agnostic manner. For example, it introduces and implements a hybrid-solver pattern, where complex optimization computation is handled off-blockchain while solution validation is performed by a smart contract. To ensure correctness, the smart contract of SolidWorx is generated and verified using a model-based approach.},

abstract = {Bitcoin is the leading cryptocurrency in the world with a total marketcap of nearly USD 33 billion, [1] with 370,000 transactions recorded daily [2]. Pseudo-anonymous, decentralized peer-to-peer electronic cash systems such as Bitcoin have caused a paradigm shift in the way that people conduct financial transactions and purchase goods. Although cryptocurrencies enable users to securely and anonymously exchange money, they can also facilitate illegal criminal activities. Therefore, it is imperative that law enforcement agencies develop appropriate analytical processes that will allow them to identify and investigate criminal activities in the Blockchain (a distributed ledger). In this paper, INTERPOL, through the INTERPOL Global Complex for Innovation, proposes a Bitcoin analytical framework and a software system that will assist law enforcement agencies in the real-time analysis of the Blockchain while providing digital crime analysts with tracing and visualization capabilities. By doing so, it is feasible to render transactions decipherable and comprehensible for law enforcement investigators and prosecutors. The proposed solution is evaluated against three criminal case studies linked to Darknet markets, ransomware and DDoS extortion.},

However, gamified interactions can result in privacy leaks and potential misuses of player-provided data. In the Smart Grid ecosystem, a smart metering framework providing some basic cryptographic primitives can enable the implementation of serious games in a privacy-friendly manner. This paper presents a smart metering architecture in which the users have access to their own high-frequency data and can use them as the input data to a multi-party secure protocol. Authenticity and correctness of the data are guaranteed by the usage of a public blockchain. The framework enables a gaming platform to administer a set of team game activities aimed at promoting a more sustainable usage of energy and water. We discuss and assess the performance of a protocol based on Shamir secret sharing scheme, which enables the members of the teams to calculate their overall consumption and to compare it with those of other teams without disclosing individual energy usage data. Additionally, the protocol impedes that the game platform learns the meter readings of the players (either individual or aggregated) and their challenge objectives.},

In this paper, we propose the design of a blockchain connected gateway which adaptively and securely maintains user privacy preferences for IoT devices in the blockchain network. Individual privacy leakage can be prevented because the gateway effectively protects users' sensitive data from being accessed without their consent. A robust digital signature mechanism is proposed for the purposes of authentication and secure management of privacy preferences. Furthermore, we adopt the blockchain network as the underlying architecture of data processing and maintenance to resolve privacy disputes.},

However the traditional supply chain faced lot of challenges these days because of the complex networks. Blockchain integrated with IoT framework has the potential to overcome the challenges faced by the conventional systems across industries. Basically the IoT integrated blockchain system provides enough benefits such as connecting the link between the flows in the supply chain to improve the efficiency of the supply chain network, makes the system transparent that can reduce the code of conduct violation throughout the supply chain networks, the immutable properties helps the stakeholders to trace the products throughout the networks. Even though blockchain based system provides enough benefits across industries, so far the implementation rate is very low because of the lack of knowledge about the benefits of blockchain system as well as lack of understanding about how and why it is needed in their fields. In this paper we will highlight the difference between the conventional supply chain as well as blockchain based supply chain and the benefits of implementing blockchain in different sectors such as automotive, pharmaceutical, food industry, retail. This article will highlights the problems currently facing by the above mentioned industries by using the conventional supply chain as well as the solutions to the problems provide the blockchain based systems in those industries.

Features such as low purchasing costs, low energy consumption, and small size make the Internet of things indispensable and irreplaceable. However, the fact that they only have enough processor power to run particular tasks has led to the failure of implementation of many traditional security measures to the IoT environment, which are developed to date. Furthermore, the producers bring early products to the market due to the market share concerns. Moreover, the lack of knowledge of security measures to be taken by developers creates lots of security loopholes and causes unauthorized persons to seize a lot of valuable information, which undermines the trust of the users. Likewise, the unpredictable and rapid growth of IoT devices highlights the importance of scalability, authorization and encryption issues. Although partial solutions are being suggested to address these concerns, a generally accepted solution still does not exist. Thanks to its tamper-proof, decentralized, distributed, programmable structure, blockchain can be used as a solution to these security concerns. Blockchain-based authentication and access control systems can be used to strengthen IoT security. Until recently, it has been thought that communication over the blockchain network is not possible for resource-constrained devices because the communication depends on using not only complex but also memory hungry cryptography algorithms.

With public blockchain deployments being severely limited in their scalability, and inherently having latency in transaction processing, there is room for researching and developing new techniques to leverage the security features of blockchains within healthcare applications. This paper presents a solution for patients to share their biomedical data with their doctors without their data being handled by trusted third party entities. The solution is built on the Ethereum blockchain as a medium for negotiating and record-keeping, along with Tor for delivering data from patients to doctors. To highlight the applicability of the solution in various health monitoring scenarios, we have considered three use-cases, namely cardiac monitoring, sleep apnoea testing, and EEG following epileptic seizures. Following the discussion about the use cases, the paper outlines a security analysis performed on the proposed solution, based on multiple attack scenarios. Finally, the paper presents and discusses a performance evaluation in terms of data delivery time in comparison to existing centralized and decentralized solutions.},

abstract = {Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANET) are also known as intelligent transportation systems. VANET ensures timely and accurate communications between vehicle to vehicle (V2V) and vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) to improve road safety and enhance the efficiency of traffic flow. Due to its open wireless boundary and high mobility, VANET is vulnerable to malicious nodes that could gain access into the network and carry out serious medium access control (MAC) layer threats, such as denial of service (DoS) attacks, data modification attacks, impersonation attacks, Sybil attacks, and replay attacks. This could affect the network security and privacy, causing harm to the information exchange within the network by genuine nodes and increase fatal impacts on the road. Therefore, a novel secure trust-based architecture that utilizes blockchain technology has been proposed to increase security and privacy to mitigate the aforementioned MAC layer attacks. A series of experiment has been conducted using the Veins simulation tool to assess the performance of the proposed solution in the terms of packet delivery ratio (PDR), end-to-end delay, packet loss, transmission overhead, and computational cost.},

abstract = {Mobile Crowdsourcing (MCS) is an effective and novel method of data collection and processing. Current MCS generally adopts a centralized architecture by depending on an assumed trusted party. This design easily suffers from single-point failure and cannot be realized in practice since a trusted service provider does not really exist. More dangerously, the centralized party may perform dishonestly and thus harms the benefit and privacy of MCS users. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel blockchain-based MCS system, named MCS-Chain, to realize fully distributed and decentralized trust management in MCS. Aiming at improving the poor efficiency of traditional blockchain technology, we propose a novel consensus mechanism for block generation, which greatly reduces computational overhead. The proposed MCS-Chain system also solves the fork issue and centralization problem suffered by most existing blockchain-based systems. Serious security analysis and experimental evaluation further illustrate the security and efficiency of our system.},

More than 570 cars per 1,000 people, a number projected to increase with the arrival of Expo 2020, fuels this congestion each day. Reducing individual car ownership is one solution to this challenge; carsharing services provide a proven pathway. Indeed, car-sharing service car2go demonstrated that each vehicle in their fleet removed up to 11 personal cars from the road. Embracing this option, in 2017 Dubai Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) launched a car-sharing service with two private firms: Udrive and ekar. Both firms offer a smartphone app and technology with which users can find, unlock, and rent cars at more than 45 locations across Dubai. The objective of this paper is to explore in case study format the strategy and technology of one of these providers, ekar, while evaluating the implications of blockchain functionality and internet of things features on the digital drivetrain of the carsharing service.},

The Clondike project is being converted from a grid computing system into a universal non-dedicated P2P cluster where every participating node can benefit from its membership in the cluster. But different design requires different types of algorithms in order to guarantee the same functionality. One of the challenges in P2P design is a fair scheduling and a general protection of the whole cluster against abusive or malfunctioning nodes. Algorithms used in a single-master or multi-master clusters do not work anymore. We have designed a multi-level system based on one of the main principles of cryptocurrencies to achieve a distributed master-less reputation rating across the cluster. This paper discusses proposed cluster multi-level reputation system and its parameters. The system is evaluated on a Clondike cluster on an experimental measurement with abusive nodes involved.},

abstract = {Since Bitcoin and Blockchain became popular, various industries have been interested in applying Blockchain technology to their business. Companies have been working on many Proof-of-Concepts to find good use cases. To find use cases quickly in the fast-changing environment around Blockchain, companies repeat short-Term Proof-of-Concepts many times. There is some work on evaluation methods for Blockchain-based systems like the evaluation form validating the feasibility of Blockchain-based systems with comprehensive evaluation items and prototypes. However, the previous evaluation methods do not satisfy the tight time constraints of Proof-of-Concepts conducted by companies. It takes a long time to define evaluation indices, implement measurement tools and run a series of tests for all evaluation items. It also takes more time to repeat the evaluation to compare multiple Blockchain-based systems using different Blockchain software products. In this paper, we propose a practical screening method for Blockchain-based systems. To reduce time spent on Proof-of-Concepts, the screening phase with a simple check form is introduced before the prototyping phase. Throughout the screening phase, a screening form selects a few Blockchain software products which demonstrate good coverage of requirements for a use case in terms of network topology, settlement finality, governance, privacy/confidentiality and application architecture. After choosing a few promising Blockchain software products, the prototyping phase follows. Prototypes using selected Blockchain software products are evaluated by filling comprehensive evaluation items like the previous methods. The time required for Proof-of-Concepts decreases due to eliminating unpromising Blockchain software products in the screening phase. For the evaluation of the proposed method, we had a case study. The result showed that the estimated workload of a Proof-of-Concept decreased by 59% compared to the previous method.},

abstract = {The Internet of things (IoT) presents new opportunities and challenges due to its scale and dynamic nature. One significant challenge for the IoT is the need for security, in particular access control solutions, that are designed to meet the characteristics of these systems. Delegation of rights, from one entity to another, is a crucial component of an access control system. The IoT requires a secure, flexible, and fine-grained delegation model. While there has been considerable work in the area of delegation, much of it assumes a centralized, well-resourced system and these solutions have limited capacity in the context of the IoT. Where delegation models for the IoT have been proposed they typically provide only coarse-grained control over the delegation of rights. Moreover, many of them require a centralized trusted authority, which can suffer from a single-point failure and is not an ideal base for a large and dynamic system like the IoT. In this paper, we propose an identity-less, asynchronous, and decentralized delegation model for the IoT based on blockchain technology. We describe system components, architecture, and key aspects related to the security of the system. We use attributes to validate an entity rather than depending upon unique identities. We demonstrate the feasibility of our model through use-case examples and analyze the performance with a proof of concept testbed implementation using Ethereum private blockchain.},

Several algorithms are proposed to lower the benefits of ASIC including memory-intensive hash algorithms, where the memory access patterns are random and depend on input data. To further lower the potential hardware acceleration, in this paper, we introduce irregular-program-based hash algorithms, where both the code path and memory access are random and depend on input data. We present an example of the hash algorithm based on dynamic search tree (DST), which exhibits both control-path and memory-access irregularities. We compare the performance of a CPU-based implementation of the DST to an existing FPGA-based implementation, which shows comparable performance. An instance of the proposed hash algorithm is elaborated, and the test inputs and outputs are given.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Community-based online platforms for hospitality services have connected hosts and guests globally. With the increasing popularity of those platforms - e.g., Airbnb - some management issues have attracted the attention of researchers - for instance, granting access to properties and rooms remotely, without requiring hosts and guests to meet in person. Solutions have been proposed - e.g., locks with pin pad and vendor centralized smart locks - but they usually have shortcomings that compromise either security, privacy, or convenience. This research designs and proposes a blockchain-based system for smart door locks to provide the convenience of remote access control management, while security and privacy for both hosts and guests are not compromised. Moreover, to surpass current locks' functionalities, this research proposes a feature that enables the guests to cease the hosts' access to the lock, during their stay. This feature also guarantees to the guest that no one will be able to change that access rule without their explicit approval. The proposed solution integrates Ethereum blockchain as the foundation of the system and uses Infura API as the bridge to connect the IoT infrastructure to the blockchain network. Such architecture alleviates hardware demand from the equipment, which can favor the use of resource-constrained IoT devices. Once Ethereum is used to build the solution, and users are charged fees to perform some actions in the blockchain, the system is evaluated concerning operation costs. Three Ethereum test networks - Ganache, Ropsten, and Rinkeby - were used to run the smart contract and assess the charge to complete significant actions in the system. The results show that the cost to use the smart lock is low, especially if the benefits of security, privacy, and convenience are taken into consideration. Most of the actions yielded fees about cents of a US dollar, where the exception is a one-time payment of USD3.83 - worst-case scenario - to deploy the smart contract - i.e., setup the system.},

abstract = {This study investigates a range of data security models developed to achieve data security using blockchain technology for different industrial domains. Current industries utilize data-driven mechanisms for decision making with concern focussed on ensuring data security. Blockchain has the potential to secure data by integrating different information systems since data is decentralized, encrypted and validated by the whole network. This study includes an analysis of blockchain security models using data extracted from 30 peer-reviewed scientific publications over two years (2017-2019). This study analyzed three components of the publications, including the process involved in securing data, the stage of development for securing data and in which industry a model is best applied. Results of the research show that the majority of articles (51.11%) cited Blockchain as a key feature of data security for improvising the data sharing process in industries. This study also finds that the stage of implementation most commonly featured is the proposal stage with potential architectures yet to be implemented (30%). Finally, this study shows that models are applied in industrial domains such as enterprises using data analytics, finance, Internet of Things (IoT), healthcare, education, and cloud service providers. This study finds that security models are most often applied to industries and supply chain management models (28.13%). It is recommended that industry professionals conduct further research to customize the data security models in their own domain. This study gives clear guidelines to researchers of suitable frameworks, processes and consensus mechanism to utilize Blockchain in Industries for data security.},

abstract = {Molecular and genetic therapeutics, extended lifespans, and the repair augmentation of the human body remain key cornerstones of current, emerging and future medical science and technology. While internal and external prosthetics have formed the foundation of this goal, the growing utility and ubiquity of genetic engineering and synthetic genomics - already being successful in early preventative therapeutic applications - promise a future in which cells, tissues and organs are likely to be designed to express novel biological structures and preprogrammed functions, the latter encompassing those capable of performing technological operations, including but not limited to direct communications with the exogenous world. Achieving this will require and accelerate the ongoing interdigitation of biology and technology, with these two domains eventually merging. This emergent transdisciplinarian environment will have the potential to render external and implanted technological devices obsolete, as their features are then performed by their synthetic biological and molecular replacements. There is, however, one operational concern for which a solution has yet to have been determined - that is, anomalies in synthetic genomics and genome engineering somatic expression. Here, I propose a blockchain-based solution that - rather than being limited to providing genomic privacy, security and anonymous data analysis, as is currently the case - would provide a method for reversing phenotypical expression errors should they occur. By so doing, ReGene addresses both actual and perceived risk, thereby ameliorating personal, medical, legislative and other areas of resistance to commercial applications of advanced genetic engineering and synthetic genomics.},

abstract = {With peer-to-peer software technologies based on Blockchain and Smart Contracts, automated negotiation of client-server relationships for enterprise networking and project-oriented fractal organizations can now be readily implemented. To this aim, the distributed (emergent) schedule of client-server contracts must be a Nash equilibrium from which any agent finds no incentive to deviate. Also, to respond effectively to unplanned events and disturbances, the renegotiating process of all concerned client-server contracts must pursue a new Nash equilibrium solution in the face of incomplete information by each individual agent. In this work, distributed multi-project (re)scheduling is formulated as a repeated-negotiation game in a multi-agent setting where each agent resorts to decoupled learning rules for deciding the terms and conditions in each contract settlement. After a finite number of stages of the negotiation game, a new emergent schedule close to a Nash equilibrium is found. An agent-based simulation framework is proposed to implement the repeated negotiation game based on bilateral client-server contracts. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated using a case study of a project-oriented fractal company in the pharmaceutical industry. Simulation results obtained highlight that repeated negotiations and decoupled learning are key for approaching a Nash equilibrium and welfare solutions to a (re)scheduling problem.},

abstract = {As a result of the development of the Industry 4.0 concept, the physical characteristics of production and the production process were transferred to the digital form. This process is also known as production digitalization. Digitalization allows creating so-called digital twins of production components, among which are smart objects, including machines (production robots), people, software services, processed materials and manufactured products. Digital twins allow to display not only the current state of the component, but also predict its actions according the current situation by creating behavior patterns. The interaction of digital twins is carried out through the cloud platform of the Internet of Things using an ontological representation to ensure interoperability. Interaction via cloud IoT platform causes problems associated with providing trust in the distribution of consumables between components of the industrial IoT system. One of the recent solutions to such problems is using of blockchain technology. In this paper, an example of the integration of industrial IoT and blockchain technology is presented. Each component of the system is represented by a corresponding digital twin, capable of interacting on-the-fly with ontologies in the IoT and blockchain network. To solve the problem of control and exchange of consumable resources in IIoT, this paper proposes classification and principles of resource tokenization depending on their class. The tokenization has been checked by creating smart contracts for consumables allocation on Hyperledger Fabric platform.},

abstract = {The need for greater health data sharing is widely acknowledged in the healthcare industry. The provision of healthcare services and attempts to harness Big Data analytics are adversely affected by the fragmentation of medical data across healthcare providers. However, attempts to encourage greater data sharing have been unsuccessful due to privacy concerns and lack of motivation for patients to share their data. We propose CrowdMed, a medical data management framework to facilitate greater data sharing, empowering patients with full control over access to their medical data. The framework is fully transparent, ensuring that patients have full knowledge over how who has access to their data, and how their data is being used. Using blockchain as the foundation for consent management, patients can trust that only parties with permission can view their data. Permissions are also finely specified, and can be revoked or modified according to the patient's wishes. Following these permissions, data is transferred automatically between parties, conveniently and efficiently alleviating the problem of data fragmentation. CrowdMed also addresses the lack of motivation for data sharing, incentivising patients to share more of their data for research purposes through reward tokens and an innovative pricing mechanism. The framework integrates fully with existing data storage architecture, aiding in its widespread adoption.},

abstract = {Growing consumer awareness as well as manufacturers' internal quality requirements lead to novel demands on supply chain traceability. Existing centralized solutions suffer from isolated data storage and lacking trust when multiple parties are involved. Decentralized blockchain-based approaches attempt to overcome these shortcomings by creating digital representations of physical goods to facilitate tracking across multiple entities. However, they currently do not capture the transformation of goods in manufacturing processes. Therefore, the relation between ingredients and product is lost, limiting the ability to trace a product's provenance. We propose a blockchain-based supply chain traceability system using smart contracts. In such contracts, manufacturers define the composition of products in the form of recipes. Each ingredient of the recipe is a nonfungible token that corresponds to a batch of physical goods. When the recipe is applied, its ingredients are consumed and a new token is produced. This mechanism preserves the traceability of product transformations. The system is implemented for the Ethereum Virtual Machine and is applicable to any blockchain configuration that supports it. Our evaluation reveals that the gas costs scale linearly with the number of products considered in the system. This leads to the conclusion that the solution can handle complex use cases.},

Moreover, identity federations connect digital identities across trust domain boundaries. These traditional models have been thoroughly studied with regard to trust requirements. The recently emerging blockchain technology enables a novel decentralized identity management model that targets user-centricity and eliminates the identity provider as a trusted third party. The result is a substantially different set of entities with mutual trust requirements. In this paper, we analyze decentralized identity management based on blockchain through defining topology patterns. These patterns depict schematically the decentralized setting and its main actors. We study trust requirements for the devised patterns and, finally, compare the result to traditional models.

abstract = {A large number of studies have found a negative correlation between economic growth and corruption. Therefore, governments implement various anti-corruption measures particularly technology-based mechanisms. The government of India has launched various initiatives such as Digital India and Digital India Land Records Modernization Program (DILRMP) to modernize land records in the country and curb the corruption at various levels of land transactions. However, despite a push for reform through the DILRMP, India's current land title management system remains plagued with deficiencies. The current system of land records and property ownership is rife with corruption. DILRMP is heavily dependent on the government functionaries to act as a trusted third party for the verification of data and processing of deeds. This leaves a space for unscrupulous elements to trick the system and register a fraudulent deed, transfer land titles, and so on. This paper investigates the usefulness of an emerging technology called Blockchain and its integration with India's biometric identity program called Aadhaar for management of land records and property registration. This paper proceeds with relevant case studies, by identifying the requirements and outlining the concept and system architecture for such a solution. From our analysis, we conclude that the blockchain technology in association with Aadhaar would be an effective mechanism to bring in much-needed transparency in the government functionaries, eradicate fraud and corruption, and enhance socioeconomic benefits.},

To improve the IoV network management, resource utilization and QoS, a new architecture integrating the SDN technology have been proposed: SD-IoV. However, this architecture introduces new threats and, in particular, security is an important challenge. One of the major shortcomings with security is the lack of authentication and authorization of the applications (network, third party or user) at the distributed SD-IoV control layer. Indeed, these applications are currently able to control the SDN controllers and therefore the network behavior without any restriction. Consequently, a malicious or compromised application could easily disturb the entire network. That is why this paper proposes an innovative trust establishment system based on the blockchain technology. This system aims to control the application identity, as well as the application behavior and the network resources allocation and management. The ideas of application identity and application trust index, using the distributed nature of the SD-IoV, are introduced. Moreover, a design of this system, using smart contracts is also presented.},

abstract = {A building information model (BIM) is of upmost importance with a full life-time cycle in architecture engineering and construction industry. Smart construction relies on BIM to manipulate information flow, data flow, and management flow. Currently, BIM has been explored mainly for information construction and utilization, but there exist few works concerning information security, e.g., audits of critical models and exposure of sensitive models. Moreover, few BIM systems have been proposed to make use of new computing paradigms, such as mobile cloud computing, blockchain and Internet of Things. In this paper, we propose a Context-aware Access Control (CaAC) model for BIM systems on mobile cloud architectures. BIM data can be confidentially accessed according to contexts in a fine-grained manner. We describe functions of CaAC formally by illustrating location-aware access control and time-aware access control. CaAC model can outperform role-based access control for preventing BIM data leakage by distinguishing contexts. In addition, grouping algorithms are also presented for flexibility, in which basic model (user grouping based on user role permissions) and advanced model (user grouping based on user requests) are differentiated. Compared with the traditional role-based access control model, security and feasibility of CaAC are remarkably improved by distinguishing an identical role with multiple contexts. The average efficiency is improved by 2n/(2n p q), and time complexity is O(n).},

abstract = {Attribute-based access control makes access control decisions based on the assigned attributes of subjects and the access policies to protect objects by mediating operations from the subjects. Authority, which validates attributes of subjects, is one key component to facilitate attribute-based access control. In an increasingly decentralized society, multiple attributes possessed by subjects may need to be validated by multiple different authorities. This paper proposes a multi-authority attribute-based access control scheme by using Ethereum's smart contracts. In the proposed scheme, Ethereum smart contracts are created to define the interactions between data owner, data user, and multiple attribute authorities. A data user presents its attributes to different attribute authorities, and after successful validation of attributes, obtains attribute tokens from respective attribute authorities. After collecting enough attribute tokens, a smart contract will be executed to issue secret key to the data user to access the requested object. The smart contracts for multi-authority attribute-based access control have been prototyped in Solidity, and their performance has been evaluated on the Rinkeby Ethereum Testnet.},

abstract = {Precast construction has great potential for driving innovations in clean, safe, high-efficient construction methods in the industry. However, current precast supply chain management often faces challenges such as fragmentation, poor traceability, and lack of real-time information. To address these challenges, this study builds a novel blockchain-based information management framework for a precast supply chain, which extends the applications of blockchain in the domain of construction supply chains. In this study, a blockchain framework and its development processes are presented in detail, and algorithms for smart contracts are developed for the model implementation. Finally, the performance of this framework is validated with a case study in which a visualization system is presented to achieve (1) information sharing management, (2) real-time control of scheduling, and (3) information traceability. The results suggest that the proposed framework facilitates the on-time delivery of precast components (PCs) and tracks the reasons for disputes centered on PCs in the precast supply chain.},

abstract = {The economic development of rural India requires connecting remote villages to local and global supply chains. Yet, high rates of financial exclusion inhibit rural Indians from participating in these supply networks. We review the literature on financial inclusion, adoption, and blockchain in India, and posit that to resolve financial exclusion, the four challenges of geographical access, high cost, inappropriate banking products, and financial illiteracy need to be overcome. Next, we argue that blockchain technologies hold the potential to overcome most of these challenges. However, for blockchain technologies to become the cornerstone of financial inclusion initiatives, an understanding of technology adoption in India is needed. To guide the development of such understanding, we develop a research agenda on the antecedents of adoption, adoption patterns, and outcomes of adoption. Answering these research questions will lead to a nuanced understanding of adoption of blockchain-based technologies in rural India. The practical contribution of this paper is the discussion of how blockchain can alleviate the issue of financial exclusion in rural India, thereby providing a basis for a solution that could connect rural Indians to global supply chain networks. The theoretical contribution lies in the identification of knowledge gaps that should be answered to achieve financial inclusion of rural Indians.},

They provide a convenient way to collect patient data, but they also bring serious problems which are mainly reflected in the safe storage of the collected data. The privacy and security of data storage in WBAN devices cannot meet the needs of WBAN users. Therefore, this paper adopts blockchain technology to store data, which improves the security of the collected data. Moreover, a storage model based on blockchain in WBAN is proposed in our solution. However, blockchain storage brings new problems, for example, that the storage space of blockchain is small, and the stored content is open to unauthorized attackers. To solve the problems above, this paper proposed a sequential aggregate signature scheme with a designated verifier (DVSSA) to ensure that the user's data can only be viewed by the designated person and to protect the privacy of the users of WBAN. In addition, the new signature scheme can also compress the size of the blockchain storage space.},

First, it is a distributed peer-to-peer network where there is no need for third part to execute operations between peers. Second, blockchain implements mechanisms to make the most data sensitive operations executed in a trusted way. Regarding these attractive aspects, we intend in this work to use the blockchain technology for the implementation of touristic itineraries. We consider the latter as process choreographies involving different participants. We intend to model and execute the touristic itineraries generated from a personalized trip planner called CART in raw XML format in a way that respects this collaborative aspect and resolves the problem of trust. We will propose a pattern and its transformation rules to reconstruct the itineraries presented in declarative annotations such as XML to smart contracts written in some smart contract-specific programming language called Solidity. Experimental results show promising perspectives of the deployment of the proposed solution to execute touristic plans.},

The main requirements are formulated, which should be met by information systems accompanying the urban development, and it is also shown that the present existing and traditional architecture does not fully meet the requirements for the majority of information systems such as "data storage - information consumer". A new approach to the construction of information systems for the provision of city planning activity based on the recently emerged protocols of interaction in the information field and information technologies is proposed.

abstract = {Unsolicited, and most likely spoofed, robot calls are not just an annoyance, but also carry a potential threat with the onset of automation, impersonation, and even voice manipulation technologies as malicious elements attempt to use deception to steal sensitive information or invoke action. Despite steps taken to protect consumers, the issue appears to be far from under control. In this paper, we propose a solution to use blockchain as a platform to share spam transactions through a peer-To-peer mechanism that will maintain a global database of reported spam transactions in order to identify and trace spam activity effectively. Storing spam transactions on a distributed ledger with consensus-based approval of transactions adds reliability to the data and can optimize the data points that will be available to spam detection algorithms in order to fight spam effectively. As this is peer to peer-based sharing, there is no need to rely on third-party providers for storing and sharing this data to the users. Every spam call received will be added as a detailed transaction on the blockchain to execute a smart contract that will calculate the trustworthiness of the caller. Call records are used to identify spam transactions while the blockchain ledgers store this data. We discuss the relevance and advantages of a distributed ledger to store these transactions. This paper does not aim at solving the spam problem with an optimized detection algorithm but evaluates the characteristics and performance of the blockchain as a distributed ledger and its relevance to serve as a platform for peer-To-peer spam detection mechanisms. We evaluate different blockchain metrics like transaction processing rates, gas costs and ledger sizes and discuss how they scale in order to store the spam reports data on the blockchain.},

abstract = {With the explosive growth of smart IoT devices at the edge of the Internet, embedding sensors on mobile devices for massive data collection and collective environment sensing has been envisioned as a cost-effective solution for IoT applications. However, existing IoT platforms and framework rely on dedicated middleware for (semi-) centralized task dispatching, data storage and incentive provision. Consequently, they are usually expensive to deploy, have limited adaptability to diverse requirements, and face a series of data security and privacy issues. In this paper, we employ permissionless blockchains to construct a purely decentralized platform for data storage and trading in a wireless-powered IoT crowdsensing system. In the system, IoT sensors use the power wirelessly transferred from RF-energy beacons for data sensing and transmission to an access point. The data is then forwarded to the blockchain for distributed ledger services, i.e., data/transaction verification, recording, and maintenance. Due to the coupled interference of wireless transmission and the transaction fee incurred by the blockchain's distributed ledger services, rational sensors have to decide on their transmission rates to maximize their individual payoff. Thus, we formulate a noncooperative game model to analyze this competitive situation among the sensors. We provide the analytical condition for the existence of the Nash equilibria as well as a series of insightful numerical results about the equilibrium strategies in the game.},

Besides, the electronic voting system has been active subject research for decades. However, the old traditional voting system lacks security and privacy features, which has been a challenge for a long time. As a solution, this paper is proposing a prototype blockchain-based electronic voting system for the United Arab Emirates (UAE) political election process. A blockchain system is a distributed decentralized, immutable database; that allows the data to be distributed and shared among all the participants in a network. Also, it has many advantages that can be applied in many use cases, such as electronic voting systems. Implementing the blockchain-based electronic voting system will minimize the costs of running an election while ensuring integrity. It has the potential to limit voter fraud while making the votes traceable and verifiable, preventing unauthorized activity, and fake votes by authenticating each voter in the system. The UAE has a blockchain initiative that seeks to have 50 percent paperless transactions in all its governmental processes by the end of 2021.

abstract = {Controlling the access over the stored data in the cloud is one of the fundamental security requirements, especially with the wide usage of cloud storage servers for nearly most of the enterprise applications. Traditional cloud-based access control solutions are based on a centralized approach (i.e. a cloud server becomes the central authority to control accesses to the data), which makes it difficult to prevent malicious cloud servers from disclosing user's data; and therefore compromising the privacy of the stored data. Additionally, the centralization of authority can cause a single point of failure. Furthermore, to provide confidentiality, which is one of the essential security requirements, user's data is encrypted before it is stored on the cloud. Most of the cloud servers store the decryption keys, after they encrypt the data, in their premises. This compromises data privacy. In this paper we propose a new model that addresses the aforementioned issues. To address the centralization problem, we distributed the access control tasks to smart contracts over a decentralized network, i.e. blockchain. To address the latter, we used Shamir secret sharing scheme to manage the encryption keys. Then we introduced a new type of node, called master node, to our blockchain platform, to store the decryption key parts.},

In the literature, existing architectures for permission delegation and access control are either event-based or query-based. These previous works assume a single trusted delegation service, which however is likely biased or fails to service. Also, they fail to allow users to verify delegation service operations, as such cannot be directly applied to IoT (Internet of Things) due to low power, low-bandwidth, ad-hoc and decentralized nature. This paper proposes a novel decentralized architecture for permission delegation and access control for IoT application, with demands on event and query base permission delegation. We further apply Blockchain (BC) technology to make delegation services secure, trusted, verifiable and decentralized. We investigate our proposed approach in Simple PROMELA INterpreter (SPIN) model checker using PROMELA (Process Meta Language).

abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to explain the architecture and design choices of the exchange. Lykke is a FinTech company based in Zurich that has launched the global marketplace for all asset classes and instruments digitized on the blockchain. The authors discuss how the exchange will evolve over time. They explore the macroeconomic benefits of the new blockchain technology. The Lykke exchange is compatible with any type of public blockchain. Design/methodology/approach: The authors present the architecture of an exchange for colored coins. By colored coins, they mean issuer-backed securities on the Bitcoin blockchain. Orders are collected and matched by a semi-trusted exchange. Matched orders are settled on the Bitcoin blockchain, where each successful trade between parties appears as a set atomic-colored coins swap transactions. Unfilled and expired orders are discarded. The exchange does not take possession of the traded coins, but needs to be trusted to match trades correctly. Findings: Lykke has launched the exchange initially for the main currencies, cryptocurrencies and Lykke coin (entitlement to the shares of Lykke company). Perspective asset classes include futures and options on digital assets, crowd-funded loans for retail and private equity financing for small and medium-sized enterprises, contracts for difference, zero coupon bonds and other fixed income and natural capital bonds. Originality/value: Lykke exchange and all its tools and services are open source; the transparency of technology is ideal for research. The paper provides a high-level overview of the exchange and concludes with a research agenda.},

abstract = {To improve mobile users' quality-of-experience (QoE) in the mobile cyber-physical system (MCPS), caching layered-coding contents on edge nodes that are close to mobile users has been advocated as a promising solution, which can efficiently lower the content delivery delay and mitigate the overhead of backhaul network. However, due to the complexity of trust management and the limited caching capacities of edge nodes, designing an efficient edge caching scheme for mobile users becomes a challenge. Meanwhile, the content caching in MCPS also faces some security problems, where edge nodes may return incorrect results or viruses to mobile users, and mobile users would deliberately refuse to pay for caching services. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel blockchain-based trustworthy edge caching scheme for mobile users in MCPS. Specifically, we first exploit blockchain to supervise the caching transactions between the edge nodes and mobile users in a distributed manner, whereby the caching service information cannot be modified and denied by any entities. Furthermore, we devise a trust management mechanism for mobile users to search the trustworthy caching services from diversified edge nodes, where the trust degree of the edge node is real-time evaluated and updated by mobile users based on the quality of caching service. To take full advantage of caching resources, we design a max-min-based resource allocation algorithm, with which the trustworthy edge node could fairly allocate its caching resource based on mobile users' optimal demands. The simulation results show that the presented scheme not only improves the utilities of edge nodes but also increases the QoE of mobile users.},

abstract = {With the vast increase in data transmission due to a large number of information collected by devices, data management, and security has been a challenge for organizations. Many data owners (DOs) outsource their data to cloud repositories due to several economic advantages cloud service providers present. However, DOs, after their data are outsourced, do not have complete control of the data, and therefore, external systems are incorporated to manage the data. Several kinds of research refer to the use of encryption techniques to prevent unauthorized access to data but prove to be deficient in providing suitable solutions to the problem. In this article, we propose a secure fine-grain access control system for outsourced data, which supports read and write operations to the data. We make use of an attribute-based encryption (ABE) scheme, which is regarded as a suitable scheme to achieve access control for security and privacy (confidentiality) of outsourced data. This article considers different categories of data users, and make provisions for distinct access roles and permissible actions on the outsourced data with dynamic and efficient policy updates to the corresponding ciphertext in cloud repositories. We adopt blockchain technologies to enhance traceability and visibility to enable control over outsourced data by a DO. The security analysis presented demonstrates that the security properties of the system are not compromised. Results based on extensive experiments illustrate the efficiency and scalability of our system.},

abstract = {The world is moving towards progress, to achieve the desired progress, the world should have a healthy population and health records are the projections of an individual's health over time. The centralised approach of maintaining the health records lead to data breaches. According to 2017 Ponemon Cost of Data Breach Study, the cost of the data breach for healthcare organizations estimated to be $380 per record. According to 2016 Breach Barometer Report, 27,314,647 patient records were affected. So we moved towards institution-driven approach of record maintenance, which didn't make much difference with the previously existing one. Since the patient have no control over the data, the chances of data being misused is high. So we need a patient-centered approach which is completely decentralised, which can identify data thefts, prevent data manipulation, and patient has the right in access control. Blockchain Technology serves as a best solution to address all the problems and fulfill the needs. Blockchain being a decentralised and distributed ledger it can also impact on billing, record sharing, medical research, identify thefts and financial data crimes in days to come. Implementation of smart contracts in health care can simplify things even better. Where invoking, record creation and validation will be done on Blockchain. This paper highlights on the patient-driven model of record maintenance using Blockchain technology where smart contracts can be incorporated in future days making it more potential in data exchange. Finding its huge scope, hoping that more researches will be carried out and practically implemented.},

As decentralized ledger technologies, especially permissioned networks, find more applicability beyond cryptocurrencies in enterprise solutions is expected that the security requirements will increase. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an access control system that works in a decentralized environment without compromising the unique features of a decentralized ledger. Decentralized ledger based access control schemes have been proposed but have limitations such as lack of capability to protect the access history and detect/tolerate malicious participants. In order to address these concerns, we propose a novel decentralized ledger based access control system that utilizes cryptography. The newly proposed system is flexible and works with various storage system. The proposed system also provides verifiability for end users to detect compromised nodes in the decentralized ledger and high level privacy. We implement the scheme using Hyperledger Fabric and give detailed information of the prototype, and also assess its performance to show that it is practical for real world applications.},

abstract = {Introduction: Patients with diabetes often generate large amounts of data specifically related to the disease and to their general health. Cross-institutional sharing of patient health care data is complex, and as a consequence, data are not always available to the health care provider treating the patient. Accommodating this challenge could lead to better clinical effectiveness and improve clinical research. This work aims to present an approach for a blockchain-based platform for sharing health care data. The approach considers privacy concerns, data sharing, and patients as the center for governing their own data. Methods: The concept of this blockchain-based platform consists of using the NEM multi-signature blockchain contracts for access control of data management and the sharing and encryption of data to allow privacy and control of health care data. The architecture is built around cryptography, tokens, and multi-signature contracts. The multi-signature contract enables several entities to administrate the activity of an account and control the assets of one account. Multi-signature generates a contract that assigns the rights and powers of a certain account to other accounts; this contract can be edited to allow or remove entities. Discussion: Using blockchain could lead to improvements in diabetes data management. In the coming years, this technology should be implemented in existing small-scale diabetes health care system to explore its real-world benefits and challenges. Conclusion: This new approach could potentially lead to more efficient sharing of data between institutions and utilization of new types of data and research possibilities.},

Recent years have witnessed an exponential growth and interest in developing smart systems, enabling the identification of innovative solutions for industrial, domestic, and agricultural sectors. Various applications have been built and deployed in IoT space that leverage the increasing ubiquity of radio-frequency identification (RFID), wireless, mobile, and sensor devices. However, the current IoT paradigm with traditional cloud-based architecture is not scaled for the future, and requires all data to be transferred to a central point for analysis and action. This centralized processing model presents numerous challenges with the future need to connect hundreds of billions of devices. The major bottlenecks are associated with various dimensions such as cost of connectivity, meaningful value creation from sensor data, reliability, establishing digital trust, traceability, preventing concentration of power, unmanageable complexity, security, privacy, and latency. One solution to overcome these hurdles is to bring the concept of decentralization to the IoT space to build distributed IoT. This paper presents the current state of the research on IoT and its potential business use cases along with a case study on distributed IoT. It also discusses various challenges and opportunities in decentralized ecosystems, along with open research questions and future directions.},

abstract = {The rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the explosive growth of valuable data produced by user equipment have led to strong demand for access control, especially hierarchical access control, which is performed from a group communication perspective. However, the key management strategies for such a future Internet are based mostly on a trusted third party that requires full trust of the key generation center (KGC) or central authority (CA). Recent studies indicate that centralized cloud centers will be unlikely to deliver satisfactory services to customers because we place too much trust in third parties; therefore, these centers do not apply to user privacy-oriented scenarios. This paper addresses these issues by proposing a novel blockchain-based distributed key management architecture (BDKMA) with fog computing to reduce latency and multiblockchains operated in the cloud to achieve cross-domain access. The proposed scheme utilizes blockchain technology to satisfy the decentralization, fine-grained auditability, high scalability, and extensibility requirements, as well as the privacy-preserving principles for hierarchical access control in IoT. We designed system operations methods and introduced different authorization assignment modes and group access patterns to reinforce the extensibility. We evaluated the performance of our proposed architecture and compared it with existing models using various performance measures. The simulation results show that the multiblockchain structure substantially improves system performance, and the scalability is excellent as the network size increases. Furthermore, dynamic transaction collection time adjustment enables the performance and system capacity to be optimized for various environments.},

Health care researchers today struggle with delayed communications, scattered data and delayed medical workflows caused by conflicting eHealth care systems which makes it difficult to provide personalized care. The main problem is a lack of trust between these independent eHealth care systems which makes it difficult to establish an end-to-end accessible network.

In this regard, the recent development of blockchain technology provides a potential viable solution thanks to its unique advantages in decentralization and security. As such, we propose a new framework of cloud manufacturing by integrating the blockchain technology. In essence, consensus-oriented mechanisms are employed to generate the operating standards for the blockchain cloud manufacturing model. Moreover, based on the open source Ethereum code, we construct a simulation case study for 3D printing services using the proposed framework. A consortium or federated blockchain is simulated which uses Proof-of-Authority (PoA) as the consensus algorithm of block generation. The simulation involves 939 job requests from 100 users, as well as 10 service providers. The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is employed to recommend the service provider for each request. The results show that the provider's score of service evaluation tends to be stabilize, and 934 requests for service are successfully fulfilled by the appropriate providers while the remaining 5 requests fail to be serviced.},

In this systematic review, an analysis of state-of-the-art blockchain research in the field of healthcare is conducted. The aim is to reveal the potential applications of the technology and to highlight the challenges and possible directions of blockchain research in healthcare. First, background information is discussed, followed by a description of the exact methodology used in this paper. Next, an analysis of the results is given, which includes a bibliometric overview, an analysis of gathered data and its properties, and the results of a literature quality assessment. Lastly, there is a discussion of the results from the analysis. The findings indicate that blockchain technology research in healthcare is increasing and it is mostly used for data sharing, managing health records and access control. Other scenarios are very rare. Most research is aimed at presenting novel structural designs in the form of frameworks, architectures or models. Findings also show that technical details about the used blockchain elements are not given in most of the analyzed publications and that most research does not present any prototype implementation or implementation details.

Meanwhile, it is designed to leverage the distributed ledger to harden both data and query integrity. To deal with continuously generated IoT data, we further devise an efficient secure data insertion protocol, and employ a recent variant of blockchain for users to validate updated query results in a scalable manner.

The core idea is to build trust domains for the various stakeholders and IoMT devices, in such a way that fine-grain access is enabled by taking into account critical attributes of the IoMT ecosystem such as a) the different roles and capabilities of the IoMT devices and b) their interaction with the users/stakeholders. A private blockchain is used in combination with on-chain smart contracts to allow for a forensics-by-design management architecture with audit trails for integrity and provenance guarantees as well as health data privacy. The private blockchain ecosystem is authenticated by a proof-of-medical-stake consensus mechanism that is tailored for medical applications.},

abstract = {This paper considers the use of novel technologies for mitigating attacks that aim at compromising intrusion detection systems (IDSs). Solutions based on collaborative intrusion detection networks (CIDNs) could increase the resilience against such attacks as they allow IDS nodes to gain knowledge from each other by sharing information. However, despite the vast research in this area, trust management issues still pose significant challenges and recent works investigate whether these could be addressed by relying on blockchain and related distributed ledger technologies. Towards that direction, the paper proposes the use of a trust-based blockchain in CIDNs, referred to as trust-chain, to protect the integrity of the information shared among the CIDN peers, enhance their accountability, and secure their collaboration by thwarting insider attacks. A consensus protocol is proposed for CIDNs, which is a combination of a proof-of-stake and proof-of-work protocols, to enable collaborative IDS nodes to maintain a reliable and tampered-resistant trust-chain.},

abstract = {Blockchain, a Distributed Ledger Technology, is a disruptive and revolutionary technology that enables transacting data in a decentralized structure without the need for trusted central authorities. Many industries have taken steps to unleash the potential of blockchain technology, including the government sector, and early adopters are exploring the use of blockchain as one of the critical capabilities needed to create new business models and to radically transform government services and functions. However, despite this interest in adopting Blockchain technology, there is a lack of Blockchain frameworks or reference models/architecture that addresses government services in literature. In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain model that can be adopted by governments to establish government-led blockchain ecosystem for government services. The blockchain model is proposed based on the outcomes of our analysis of permissioned blockchain platform, and analysis of blockchain powered housing rentals use case that is being implemented by the Dubai Government. The proposed blockchain model outcomes includes a blockchain governance structure, participants and roles definition, and network architecture design which explains the deployment options and components. We also explain the model lifecycle and blockchain services, and we shed the light on the security and performance of the model. The study also includes exploring many blockchain use cases used by governments through proofs of concept or prototypes. Our analysis of Hyperledger Fabric design features shows the platform's relevance to government services and use cases. The Hyperledger Fabric analysis also identifies the platform's actors, services, processes and data structure of Hyperledger Fabric.},

@article{Kurdi_2019,
abstract = {Delivering electronic health care (eHealth) services across multi-cloud providers to implement patient-centric care demands a trustworthy brokering architecture. Specifically, such an architecture should aggregate relevant medical information to allow informed decision-making. It should also ensure that this information is complete and authentic and that no one has tampered with it. Brokers deployed in eHealth services may fall short of meeting such criteria due to two key behaviors. The first involves violating international health-data protection laws by allowing user anonymity and limiting user access rights. Second, brokers claiming to provide trustworthy transactions between interested parties usually rely on user feedback, an approach vulnerable to manipulation by malicious users. This paper addresses these data security and trust challenges by proposing HealthyBroker, a novel, trust-building brokering architecture for multiple cloud environments. This architecture is designed specifically for patient-centric cloud eHealth services. It enables care-team members to complete eHealth transactions securely and access relevant patient data on a “need-to-know” basis in compliance with data-protection laws. HealthyBroker also protects against potential malicious behavior by assessing the trust relationship and tracking it using a neutral, tamper-proof, distributed blockchain ledger. Trust is assessed based on two strategies. First, all transactions and user feedback are tracked and audited in a distributed ledger for transparency. Second, only feedback coming from trustworthy parties is taken into consideration. HealthyBroker was tested in a simulated eHealth multi-cloud environment. The test produced better results than a benchmark algorithm in terms of data accuracy, service time, and the reliability of feedback received as measured by three malicious behavior models (na{\"{i}}ve, feedback isolated, and feedback collective). These results demonstrate that HealthyBroker can provide care teams with a trustworthy, transparent ecosystem that can facilitate information sharing and well-informed decisions for patient-centric care.},

Research on the behavior of production, education, and research organizations has attracted widespread attention. Blockchain technology is considered as another subversive technology following cloud computing, wireless sensor networks, and big data.

Blockchain technology is essentially a technical solution that collectively maintains a reliable database through a decentralized, high-trust way.

It has expected to play an important role in the establishment of a trust mechanism in the “Internet +” production, research, and innovation and promote education. Drawing on the experience in blockchain applications in the financial sector, the blockchain in the education sector mainly embodies six application modes: building individual science credit data, creating an intelligent education Taobao platform, developing a degree certificate system, and building a new ecology of open educational resources. Of course, due to the uniqueness and complexity of the trust field in the cooperation innovation of industry, universities, and research institutes, the application of blockchain technology is also faced with difficulties in the application, promotion, and operation of production and research, fuzzy ownership of educational big data, limited data storage space, and potential safety problems of blockchain technology.

Optimal management of DER will enable end-users to decrease their electricity costs and provide crucial services to grid operators.

To achieve that, a consensus-based distributed optimization algorithm is developed using the general form Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). To enable transparent and verifiable management of the network, the paper provides a comprehensive procedure for the implementation of the decentralized OPF on a private blockchain-smart contracts platform. The performance of the proposed framework is tested using real data from a case study in a residential neighborhood in Amsterdam with different varieties of DER. The implementation procedure on a blockchain-smart contracts platform may be adopted in other problems that require a smart contract to act as a virtual aggregator.},

However, most business use-cases require privacy and confidentiality for data and transactions. As a result, businesses are forced to choose private blockchain solutions and unable to take full advantage of the capabilities, benefits and infrastructure of public blockchain systems. To address this issue, we present an Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) security solution built on a private-over-public (PoP) blockchain approach. The policy based distributed operation of ABE conforms well to the blockchain concept. The cross-chain PoP approach provides the benefits from both public blockchains and private blockchains. Businesses will be able to restrict access, maintain privacy, and improve performance while still being able to leverage the distributed trust of public blockchains. This paper present the ABE-based security framework and protocol for securing data, transactions as well as smart contracts. Security analysis and performance evaluation show the proposed solution to be effective, efficient and practical. It can greatly reduce the cost and complexity for businesses compared to running isolated private blockchain solutions.},

The best practice today involves giving long-term building occupants, for example employees working in the building, access privileges to their organization areas and requiring visitors to be escorted by them. This approach is conservative and inflexible. Ideally, an automated solution is needed to manage access delegations; however, traditional role-based access control models are unwieldy in that they require the specification of all roles and their relative authority, which is a challenge in large buildings home of multiple organizations and numerous visitors. In this paper, we present a methodology based on blockchain smart contracts to describe, grant, and revoke fine-grained permissions for building users in a decentralized fashion. This method supports access control using resource description framework (RDF) graphs and implements two APIs for client applications. Leveraging the metadata of a real building, we have applied the proposed method to manage privileges in some realistic use-cases and shown that it can greatly reduce the administration overhead while providing fine-grained access control.},

In addition, no party should have the authority to disclose the full contents of the work to a third party. In this paper, we propose a blockchain based solution to the above issues. The only authentic version of the project would be the one maintained in the blockchain. Collaborators would broadcast the changes they make, and it would be added to the blockchain only after consensus from all parties.

However, it is diffcult to get a unified view pertaining to health data that have been scattered across various health centers/hospital sections. To be specific, health records are distributed across many places and cannot be integrated easily. In recent years, blockchain has arisen as a promising solution that helps to achieve the sharing of individual biomedical information in a secure way, whilst also having the benefit of privacy preservation because of its immutability. This research puts forward a blockchain-based managing scheme that helps to establish interpretation improvements pertaining to electronic biomedical systems. In this scheme, two blockchains were employed to construct the base, whereby the second blockchain algorithm was used to generate a secure sequence for the hash key that was generated in first blockchain algorithm. This adaptive feature enables the algorithm to use multiple data types and also combines various biomedical images and text records. All data, including keywords, digital records, and the identity of patients, are private key encrypted with a keyword searching function so as to maintain data privacy, access control, and a protected search function. The obtained results, which show a low latency (less than 750 ms) at 400 requests/second, indicate the possibility of its use within several health care units such as hospitals and clinics.},

abstract = {In the new global economy, data has become an important resource. Sharing data can bring their value into full play. Before the process of data sharing, due to the limitations of personal storage resources, data owners usually upload data to a public cloud server for storage. However, the method of storing data to the cloud cannot guarantee that stored data has not be accessed when its owner is unknown, and such unauthorized access behavior often results in a loss of interest to the data owner. To solve this problem, in this paper, a blockchain-based data sharing architecture is proposed. The architecture uses the way to store meta-data in isolation from raw data to avoid the possibility of user data being stolen and to ensure information security in the process of data sharing. At the same time, it describes a blockchain network model for data sharing to ensure that there is no association between unrelated entities. On the other hand, it also provides a way for data owners to distribute fine-grained access control permissions based on specific scenarios.},

It should never be compared to any existing technologies like the internet. Blockchain is pleased with the fact that it provides high satisfaction and a trust bond to its users. There are significant implementations of blockchain technology across various sectors of a country which includes the agricultural venture, education venture, and supply chain management systems. Blockchain technology can be useful in countries like India, where the agricultural sector perturb about one-sixth of the total GDP of the country and also about half of the employees working in that country.

However, Apple and similarly Android manufacturers have adopted the strategy of MAC address randomization such that their users' privacy would not be compromised in any sort. This paper, pursued the goal of studying the behavior of MAC Address randomization in iOS devices, finding an answer for the following key question: 'What does randomized MAC addresses mean for BLE-based Location Tracking and Analytics?' and investigating potential solutions to overcome this challenge and to keep track of all devices at a target venue, while respecting users' privacy. As per our studies, two main approaches are suggested, adopting each will enable Gateways to cope with the MAC address randomization strategies of the iOS devices. The first suggestion is an extension of tracking algorithm, relying on the fact that the frequency of MAC Address randomization is low enough for to keep track of the devices present at the venue, based on the first detected MAC address and its associated device, and the second proposed approach is to incorporate other data fields of the advertised Probe Requests from a target device to enhance localization performance.},

Our conclusions are based upon a large array of data collected over the course of a survey of highly qualified personnel conducted in 2017-2018 using text mining, case studies, and expert interviews. The changing requirements for workers and to their competences were assessed taking into account the level of technological development (including the use of relevant products and services by Russian and international companies) as well as the probability of certain professional skills being substituted by automated solutions in the medium term. The results indicate that impact of technologies upon various functional segments of banks' operations is varied. While most of the analyzed professions are evolving towards broader functionality, others are sliding into the “obsolete” group. In the next few years, automated systems will take full responsibility for data collection and its initial analysis, though they will not replace bank personnel fully given that they simply remain tools that help boost workers' productivity and efficiency, extend the information base, accelerate decision-making, cut costs, and reduce risks.},

This paper aims to propose a decentralized access model for IoT data, using a network architecture that we call a modular consortium architecture for IoT and blockchains. The proposed architecture facilitates IoT communications on top of a software stack of blockchains and peer-to-peer data storage mechanisms. The architecture is aimed to have privacy built into it, and to be adaptable for various IoT use cases.

abstract = {In today's on-demand computing and virtual coalition environment, cross-domain services are acquired and provided. These business domains may belong to either the same or different conflict of interest system. “Transitive access” can cause leakage of information between competitors through some other conflict of interest system's member. Therefore, a secure access control mechanism is required to detect and deny “transitive access” efficiently with minimal trust in externalist. Existing access control mechanisms focused on either single or multiple conflict of interest domains but with no “transitive access”. In addition, these existing mechanisms are centralized with inherited unfair access control and are a single point of failure. Blockchain (BC) is a shared digital ledger encompassing a list of connected blocks stored on a decentralized distributed network that is secured through cryptography. We propose a BC based access control for conflict of interest domains. We have integrated a BC in our architecture to make access control fair, verifiable and decentralized. Users access histories and “transitive accesses” are stored on BC ledger. We propose a novel mechanism called “Transitive Access Checking and Enforcement (TACE)” i.e., “Algorithm.1”. It makes an authorization decision based on BC endorsement that “transitive access” will not occur. “Algorithm.2” verifies and updates users access histories stored at BC before each request approval. Similarly, “Algorithm.3” detects possible future “transitive accesses” and updates Transitive Access Set (TAS) stored at BC after each request approval. The Simple Promela Interpreter (SPIN) model checker is used to verify the proposed mechanisms for “transitive access” detection and prevention. We have identified four conflicting sequences of execution that can cause “transitive access”. Results show that the proposed mechanism is safe against “transitive access” by checking all the four possible conflicting sequences of execution.},

Particularly, urban energy system is also experiencing digital transition; such digital transition not only offers new business models commercially, but also brings new research problems scientifically. The new capabilities enabled by these digital technologies are reshaping the generation, transmission, consumption and storage sections in the urban energy system, sequentially the traditional way of how urban energy system is designed and operated should be reexamined. Starting from here, there have been many studies regarding how various digital technologies can be applied all along the urban energy system value chain; these studies range from individuals' energy consumption pattern characterization by using customer behavior data in smart home, to complex data-driven planning of regional scale energy system. More specifically, numerous computational models have been proposed by the scientific community to mimic the dynamics of various components at various levels in the urban energy system. However, the potential benefits of applying these numerical models are somehow underestimated; we believe there are still several gaps from numerical modeling to computational intelligence which need to be bridged. In such a context, in this paper we strive to present a systematic review on the status of urban energy system related digital innovations as well as prospective outlook on the future application of such digital technologies. Through the study of this paper, we hope to identify several key points where digitalization should be prioritized in urban energy system, picture a roadmap towards future digital technology enabled intelligent urban energy system, and finally points out the research gaps that need to be fulfilled over there.},

As an important solution, collaborative intrusion detection networks or systems (CIDNs or CIDSs) are considered and adopted by many organizations to identify cyberattacks. Insider attack is one major threat to such defensive mechanisms. In the literature, challenge-based trust management scheme can help safeguard CIDNs against insider attacks. However, previous studies identified that challenge-based CIDNs may still suffer from advanced insider attacks, like passive message fingerprint attack (PMFA). Motivated by the recent blockchain research, in this work, we propose a blockchain-based approach to help enhance the robustness of challenge-based CIDNs against advanced insider attacks like PMFA, through integrating a type of blockchain-based trust. In the evaluation, we examine our approach in both simulated and real network environments. The results demonstrate that our approach is effective in defeating advanced insider attacks like PMFA and enhancing the robustness of challenge-based CIDNs, as compared with the original scheme.},

abstract = {Recording the ownership of assets has historically constituted a cumbersome procedure requiring the intervention of third parties that cannot be freely chosen and take a hefty fee. Its high cost had this process reserved for valuable assets such as real estate, cars, jewelry or artwork. The system itself is also vulnerable to corruption as records can be manipulated by malicious actors. The blockchain presents a solution to both these issues. The blockchain, as a distributed and persistent ledger, removes the need for third parties and lowers the cost of ownership record operations. Consequently, more modest assets such as IoT devices can benefit from this process as well. By registering IoT devices to the blockchain and documenting their transfers, we aim to create a chain of ownership that can be used to keep track and prove the ownership of IoT devices. In this system, a pseudonymous Proof of Ownership (PoO) must be produced and verified before a sale can occur. A PoO can also replace the product's registration process that currently depends on the original product vendor and requires the user to volunteer personal information to a private company. An extension is proposed to facilitate remote configuration of IoT devices and to improve the management of device-related secrets for owners that must configure a great number of devices.},

Thereby, the architecture is dynamic in the sense that components may join or leave the network and connections between them may change over time. The dynamic nature of Blockchain architectures makes their verification a challenge, since it involves reasoning about potentially unbounded number of components. To this end, we developed FACTum, an approach for the specification and interactive verification of dynamic architectures based on the interactive theorem prover Isabelle.

The emerging concept of Smart Workplace incorporates many CPS (e.g. Robots and Drones) to execute tasks alongside Employees both of which can be exploited as Insider Threats.

Several components of the framework were piloted in a company to discuss a real-life case study and demonstrate anomaly detection and the emerging of behavioural patterns according to objects' movement with relation to their job role, workspace position and nearest entry or exit. The empirical data was collected from a Bluetooth-based Proximity Monitoring Solution. Furthermore, a key strength of the framework is a federated Blockchain (BC) model to achieve forensic-readiness by establishing a digital Chain-of-Custody (CoC) and a collaborative environment for CPS to qualify as Digital Witnesses (DW) to support post-incident investigations.},

abstract = {Blockchain has flourished in recent years. As a decentralized system architecture, smart contracts give the blockchain a user-defined logical concept. The smart contract is an executable program that can be used for automatic transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. In 2016, the DAO attack resulted in the theft of 60M USD due to unsafe smart contracts. Smart contracts are vulnerable to hacking because they are difficult to patch and there is a lack of assessment standards for ensuring their quality. Hackers can exploit the vulnerabilities in smart contracts when they have been published on Ethereum. Thus, this study presents SoliAudit (Solidity Audit), which uses machine learning and fuzz testing for smart contract vulnerability assessment. SoliAudit employs machine learning technology using Solidity machine code as learning features to verify 13 kinds of vulnerabilities, which have been listed as Top 10 threats by an open security organization. We also created a gray-box fuzz testing mechanism, which consists of a fuzzer contract and a simulated blockchain environment for on-line transaction verification. Different from previous research systems, SoliAudit can detect vulnerabilities without expert knowledge or predefined patterns. We subjected SoliAudit to real-world evaluation by using near 18k smart contracts from the Ethereum blockchain and Capture-the-Flag samples. The results show that the accuracy of SoliAudit can reach to 90% and the fuzzing can help identify potential weaknesses, including reentrancy and arithmetic overflow problems.},

abstract = {Nowadays, the automobile industry is integrating many new features into vehicles. To provide these features, various electronic systems are being added. These systems are coordinated by different ECUs (Electronic Control Unit). Vehicle ECUs are internally connected through multiple communication buses. Any ECU connected to the bus can read or send data to other ECUs. As a result, if an adversary can compromise one of the ECUs, then the adversary will be able to access and exploit the data of other important ECUs. Moreover, an adversary can modify the stored data of an important ECU, if it is compromised. To solve these problems, we propose the use of symmetric key cryptography and elliptic curve-based Public Key Encryption (PKE) for ensuring confidentiality and the use of digital signature for ensuring integrity and authenticity. In addition, we propose the adoption of an identity-based access control to control the communication permissions. We also introduce a Blockchain-inspired mechanism to secure data stored in ECUs. Finally, we integrate a watcher to monitor the stored data and report if it is modified. We implement our concept using the ARM architecture-based Raspberry Pi Board and show that our approach can improve security in ECU communications and the watcher reports when an ECU data is modified.},

One of the key challenges from database perspective is how to ensure all the data pertaining to the actual trip and premium payment made by the users are transparently recorded so that every party in the insurance contract including the driver, the insurance company, and the financial institution is confident that the data are tamper-proof and traceable. Another challenge from information retrieval perspective is how to perform entity matching and pattern matching on customer data as well as their trip and claim history recorded on the blockchain for intelligent fraud detection. Last but not least, the drivers' trip history, once have been collected sufficiently, can be much valuable for the insurance company to do offline analysis and build statistics on past driving behaviour and past vehicle runtime. These statistics enable the insurance company to offer the users with transparent and individualized insurance quotes.

abstract = {Managing security access control has been becoming one of the open issues in Internet of Things (IoT) since the idea of IoT was introduced. The reasons being that the IoT system is built upon large numbers of constrained devices, with limited power, computing resources, and memory. Therefore, the access management needs to be highly distributed in order to ensure the scalability when many IoT nodes are connected in the system, and the cryptographic operation and other algorithms performed along with the access control mechanism have to be lightweight to fit the constrained device characteristics of IoT. The existing access controls proposed for IoT, such as Role-based Access Control (RBAC), Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC) and Capability-based Access Control (CapBAC) are not truly distributed. As for the resource limitation in the IoT devices, recent developments of more powerful microprocessors or System on Chip (SoC) allow advanced cryptographic implementation on the chip itself, e.g. public key cryptography, with the cost of performance degradation. Recently, blockchain technology which is based on distributed ledger system, gains a lot of attention from the industries and researchers. Coupled with the smart contract and various distributed consensus mechanisms, blockchain can be a good solution for providing distributed access control in IoT. This paper proposed an architecture and mechanism of blockchain and smart-contract based access control for IoT. A proof-of-concept is implemented to validate the proposed idea and its performance is evaluated to gain some preliminary sights for further developments.},

abstract = {With the increasing interest in connected vehicles along with electrification opportunities, there is an ongoing effort to automate the charging process of electric vehicles (EVs). However, charging EVs takes time and thus in-advance scheduling is needed. This, however, raises privacy concerns since frequent scheduling will expose the charging pattern of the EV to the service providers. Nevertheless, the EV needs to be authenticated which means some information will need to be provided anyway. While there have been many studies to address the problem of privacy-preserving authentication, such solutions will be void if charging payments are made through traditional means. In this paper, we tackle this problem by utilizing distributed applications enabled by Blockchain and smart contracts. We adapt zero-knowledge proofs to Blockchain for enabling privacy-preserving authentication while removing the need for a central authority. The evaluation indicates that the overhead of this process is affordable to enable real-time charging operations for connected EVs.},

abstract = {The tender process is a long and complex business process to produce a series of legal obligations related to business contracts. The purpose of conducting a tender in government is to support the work program by finding the right tender (provider of goods and services) in the government procurement program so that it can be the basis of their decision to choose the most suitable tender. At the government in Indonesia, the tender process has been carried out using an e-tendering system with the use of internet technology through LPSE. The purpose of e-tendering is to facilitate the procurement process with related parties to increase productivity, effectiveness, and transparency in the tender process. However, problems in the e-tendering system are currently centralized, so that the local LPSE organization has full control of the database and the system which can pose a threat of vulnerability to fraud, collusion, and manipulation practices. The tender selection process that is full of competition must be supported by effective and transparent technology so that it does not cause fraud and suspicion among bidders. Blockchain technology is one of the solutions that allow integrated systems without a third party because it adheres to the decentralized nature of distributed databases so that it has a copy of many users. By adopting blockchain e-tendering can reduce the source of fraud, namely database manipulation. This research will explore the process of developing a blockchain-based system with e-tendering case studies on LPSE.},

abstract = {Blockchain brings a new vision for decentralized and trusted systems with more security, resiliency and efficiency. But the barrier of deployment is relative high and BaaS (Blockchain as a Service) emerged to meet the challenge. The current mainstream BaaS providers usually adopt APIs for user access or simply migrate blockchain application to Cloud. Obviously these BaaSs are provided in centralized way which erodes the trustless mechanism and incurs lock-in risk. This paper proposes a novel service paradigm to overcome the limitation of current BaaS. The paradigm adopts deployable components to reconstruct the open and decentralized blockchain service with corresponding long-life encapsulated blockchain service. The meta blockchain service generates dedicated easy to deploy encapsulated components to build up more parties BaaS network to guarantee decentralization, auditability and better efficiency. The encapsulated blockchain service components are the seeds of the whole blockchain system. A hyperledger based implementation demonstrates the paradigm can alleviate the erosion of characteristics of blockchain and lock-in risk caused by current BaaSs.},

This heavily impacts the availability and stability of the blockchain network. This paper proposes a double-chain scheme to improve the security of the blockchain network. The problem on storage unbalance is formalized, and a heuristic algorithm named FMA is proposed, followed by a customized genetic algorithm (GA), together with a tabu search algorithm (TSA), to deal with the problem for non-local data storage. Numerical results show that the proposed FMA can obtain the same storage fitness compared with GA and TSA for the case of the small number of nodes. GA is able to outperform the other two algorithms in terms of storage fitness, and the solution quality of TSA is bound by the qualities of FMA and GA.},

In this work we describe a distributed trust model for the IoT that leverages the existing trust domains and bridges them to create endto- end trust between IoT devices without relying on any common root of trust. Furthermore we define a new cryptographic primitive, denoted as obligation chain designed as a credit-based Blockchain with a built-in reputation mechanism. Its innovative design enables a wide range of use cases and business models that are simply not possible with current Blockchain-based solutions while not experiencing traditional blockchain delays. We provide a security analysis for both the obligation chain and the overall architecture and provide experimental tests that show its viability and quality.},

The current reliance on centralized, infrastructure-dependent solutions is a serious threat to the whole management process. The entire process is mainly about processing help requests based on real-time information about the disaster, and efficiently responding to such requests by dispensing a set of limited resources available at the management's disposal. Relying on independent anonymous help givers can expand the resource availability and facilitate help provisioning. Further, Crowdsourcing can be a valuable source of information that can better guide help provisioning process. However, establishing dynamic trust relationship between help requesters, information providers, and help givers is the key enabler to such enhancement. Help requests should be probably authenticated not to waste the valuable resources, help provisioning should be rewarded to motivate help givers, and Data sharing should be verified not to act on false information. In this paper, we present a decentralized Blockchain based trust management framework to facilitate cooperative anonymous help provisioning at disaster time considering infrastructure-supported scenario.},

However, we need to consider security inherent in existing (stand-alone) devices and networks as well as those that may arise in such integrations. Especially the existing solutions are insufficient to address these fundamental security concerns. Thus, we present a blockchain-based system for secure mutual authentication, BSeIn, to enforce fine-grained access control polices. The proposed system (with integrated attribute signature, multi-receivers encryption and message authentication code) is designed to provide privacy and security guarantees such as anonymous authentication, auditability, and confidentiality. BSeIn also scales well due to the utilization of smart contract. We then evaluate the security and performance of BSeIn. For example, findings from the performance evaluation demonstrate that Initialization/Request Issuance/Chain Transaction/State Delivery/Permission Update phase only cost 12.123/4.810/6.978/0.013/2.559s, respectively.},

abstract = {Bitcoin continues to get more and more attention from the media, mainly because of the volatility of its value and insignificantly associated with the technological innovation. This cryptocurrency is supported by an immutable database and is distributed throughout a network of thousands of nodes, known as Blockchain. One way to ensure that all the concepts behind the Blockchain technology and infrastructure are seized is to conduct the development of one of the most popular context applications for it: a wallet for well-known cryptocurrencies. Yet Another Bitcoin Wallet (YABW) is a hybrid application available for both Android and iOS, which was developed with the Ionic and Angular frameworks. This application communicates with Bitcoin Blockchain to send, receive and store bitcoins; provides a set of features focused on security and user experience, and is available on the Play Store and Apple Store. A rather relevant issue that is becoming a major subject of current research is the application of the Blockchain infrastructure to other contexts that are neither directly connected to cryptocurrencies, nor are finance related. The implementation of a proof-of-concept application proposes the use of a blockchain for a specific case study: the exchange of meal vouchers of an institution amongst students. This is achieved using the decentralized platform Ethereum, which allows us to create a Smart Contract using the Solidity programming language to create a token that follows the Ethereum Request for Comment (ERC), the ERC-20 standard and represents the meal vouchers. This second application uses the architecture defined for YABW, reusing major components and custom developing specific modules to enhance the required features. There is still a lot of research to be done on the non-financial applicability of the Blockchain infrastructure and technology, but for the moment, we have left further evidence that it is possible and is a relative straight-forward process to accomplish from the technological perspective.},

abstract = {Unpredictable environmental conditions make renewable energy generators of a microgrid unreliable. Energy trade among microgrids may reduce dependency on utility grid (which uses traditional energy generator that causes massive greenhouse gas emission). Coalition formation algorithms are popular tools to execute energy trade among microgrids. In this paper we develop coalition formation method using the blockchain mechanism. Advantages of our solution over existing coalition formation algorithms for microgrid energy trade are as follows: Distributed execution: We show how to find coalition structure in a distributed fashion. It improves robustness of the computation compared with centralized executions of coalition formation algorithms. This is because failure of a centralized computing entity will lead to the failure of energy trade among all MGs but in a distributed solution such problem can be avoided.Asynchronous execution: In our solution, multiple coalition formation algorithms are executed asynchronously. Most of the existing solutions execute coalition formation algorithms at regular time intervals in synchronous fashion. Our solution reduces the waiting time for a microgrid to trade energy with other microgrids. Energy requirement of microgrids may depend on weather and changes in their energy requirement may be not synchronous, i.e., energy requirement of all microgrids may not change at the same time and after regular intervals.Scalable: We show that the distributed execution of coalition formation algorithm is more scalable than centralized algorithms for coalition formation.Convergence: We show that the proposed distributed algorithm converges quickly.Local energy trade: We show that the proposed distribution algorithm promotes local energy trade to reduce energy loss due to long transmission. It should be noted that feasibility of local energy trade depends on satisfaction of constraints in distribution network. Our solution aim to reduce the distance between matched energy supplier and energy provider if the distribution network allows such an energy transfer.Trust: The trust between a microgrid and the computation entity who is responsible for generating coalition structure is ignored in the existing solutions. We use a blockchain to eliminate such trust establishment requirement.Security and Privacy: The existing literature ignores the security of the computation framework. A MG's energy surplus / deficit reveals its energy consumption patterns and it may cause security problems. We mitigate such security problems using the blockchain mechanism.},

Considering the traffic characteristics of machine-to-machine (M2M) communications and the spectrum shortage dilemma, a cost-efficient solution is to share the underutilized spectrum allocated to human-to-human (H2H) users with M2M devices in an opportunistic manner. However, the implementation of large-scale spectrum sharing in 5G heterogeneous networks confronts many challenges, including lack of incentive mechanism, privacy leakage, security threats, and so on. This motivates us to develop a privacy-preserved, incentive-compatible, and spectrum-efficient framework based on blockchain, which is implemented in two stages. First, H2H users sign a contract with the base station for spectrum sharing, and receive dedicated payments based on their contributions. Next, the shared spectrum is allocated to M2M devices to maximize the total throughput. We elaborate the operation details of secure spectrum sharing, incentive mechanism design, and efficient spectrum allocation. A case study is presented to demonstrate the security and efficiency of the proposed framework. Finally, we outline several open issues and conclude this article.},

abstract = {Trust management has been a topic of keen interest in recent years. There has been a lot of discussion as to what new opportunities it can bring to markets, what benefits it can offer, and what system development possibilities it enables for software development. In this paper we discuss trust management and business critical information sharing in a definite group of stakeholders called Circle of Trust. We examine the key features of the Circle of Trust in military environments. We address the most essential problems and obstacles to be considered before the benefits of Circle of Trust can be fully enabled therein. As a solution to problems with the information transfer management, we propose a novel conceptual approach which ensures the privacy of the data source and transparency of information sharing utilizing the blockchain technology and modern cryptographic solutions. In addition, the concept presented enables the quantitative information trade and objective control mechanism for contractual liabilities within the consortium. The discussion and views presented in this paper can be adopted in any organization with doubts concerning the sensitive and classified contents of supply chain management or current ICT systems.},

abstract = {Recently, with the increase of smart factories, smart cities, and the 4th industrial revolution, internal user authentication is emerging as an important issue. The existing user authentication and Access Control architecture can use the centralized system to forge access history by the service manager, which can cause problems such as evasion of responsibility and internal corruption. In addition, the user must independently manage the ID or physical authentication medium for authentication of each service, it is difficult to manage the subscribed services. This paper proposes a Hybrid blockchain-based integrated ID model to solve the above problems. The user creates authentication information based on the electronic signature of the Ethereum Account, a public blockchain, and provides authentication to a service provider composed of a Hyperledger Fabric, a private blockchain. The service provider ensures the integrity of the information by recording the Access History and authentication information in the Internal-Ledger. Through the proposed architecture, we can integrate the physical pass or application for user authentication and authorization into one Unification ID. Service providers can prevent non-Repudiation of responsibility by recording their authority and access history in ledger.},

However, blockchain together with data encryption technique enables the trustless network due to the tamper-proof, anonymity and unbreakable properties. Nevertheless, there are still some shortages when combining blockchain with IoT systems, for example the storage consumption. Generally speaking, validation nodes in blockchain network need to store a complete copy of the ledger so as to verify transactions and reach the whole network consensus. However, in unmanned collaborative cognition scenarios, many devices' storage capacity are limited. Therefore, in order to solve the storage problem, we propose LS4BUCC, a low overhead storage architecture regarding to the new features of unmanned collaborative cognition systems. It selectively stores data according to the value density. Based on three storage mechanisms and two supportive methods, LS4BUCC can reduce the data storage and maintain the system security and efficiency at the same time.},

However, these storage providers work as trusted third parties to transfer and store data. This kind of cloud storage model has some weak points, such as data availability, centralized data storage, high operational cost, and security concern. In this paper, we combine the concept of blockchain with attribute-based signcryption to provide a secure data sharing in the cloud environment. The proposed scheme satisfies the security requirements of the cloud computing such as confidentiality and unforgeability. Further, the smart contract solves the problem of cloud storage such as returning wrong results as in the traditional cloud server.

abstract = {The main objective of this study is to propose a novel verification secure framework for patient authentication between an access point (patient enrolment device) and a node database. For this purpose, two stages are used. Firstly, we propose a new hybrid biometric pattern model based on a merge algorithm to combine radio frequency identification and finger vein (FV) biometric features to increase the randomisation and security levels in pattern structure. Secondly, we developed a combination of encryption, blockchain and steganography techniques for the hybrid pattern model. When sending the pattern from an enrolment device (access point) to the node database, this process ensures that the FV biometric verification system remains secure during authentication by meeting the information security standard requirements of confidentiality, integrity and availability. Blockchain is used to achieve data integrity and availability. Particle swarm optimisation steganography and advanced encryption standard techniques are used for confidentiality in a transmission channel. Then, we discussed how the proposed framework can be implemented on a decentralised network architecture, including access point and various databases node without a central point. The proposed framework was evaluated by 106 samples chosen from a dataset that comprises 6000 samples of FV images. Results showed that (1) high-resistance verification framework is protected against spoofing and brute-force attacks; most biometric verification systems are vulnerable to such attacks. (2) The proposed framework had an advantage over the benchmark with a percentage of 55.56% in securing biometric templates during data transmission between the enrolment device and the node database.},

abstract = {The implementations for decentralized consensus within Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) are varied and many, but Blockchain, the underpinning technology underneath Bitcoin has witnessed revolutionary use case success. Although blockchain emerged in the Internet commerce sector as an immutable and decentralized ledger system, it can now be seen as a framework for autonomous decentralized data processing which enforces a flat and open-access network. The primary security threat in Blockchain would be a compromise or fallacy in the Consensus mechanism. The Proof of concept (PoX) approach used in Blockchains has elegantly emulated the leader-election function required in a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) protocol to simulate the block proposal process. Proof of work (PoW), the consensus mechanism that the Bitcoin protocol employed paved the way for blockchain as a viable DLT for commerce on the internet. Many “alt-coins” subsequently came up, however PoW has saturated with the explosion of popularity of the crypto currency and other alt-coins have achieved sub-optimal solutions. There is the looming “51% attack” for resource pricing algorithms and various other attacks such as Bribe attacks, Sybil attacks and the Nothing-at-stake attack for the other alternate consensus mechanisms. The novel PoStack algorithm is a gamification of the node mining process, which enforces a simple notion: a node's chance of mining crypto currency is proportional to its belief in a node that no one else believes in. The protocol has modest computational and financial needs, which reduces the barrier to entry.},

@article{Sicilia_2019,
abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to employ the case of Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) data repositories to examine the potential of blockchain technology in the context of addressing basic contemporary societal concerns, such as transparency, accountability and trust in the policymaking process. Current approaches to sharing data employ standardized metadata, in which the provider of the service is assumed to be a trusted party. However, derived data, analytic processes or links from policies, are in many cases not shared in the same form, thus breaking the provenance trace and making the repetition of analysis conducted in the past difficult. Similarly, it becomes tricky to test whether certain conditions justifying policies implemented still apply. A higher level of reuse would require a decentralized approach to sharing both data and analytic scripts and software. This could be supported by a combination of blockchain and decentralized file system technology. Design/methodology/approach: The findings presented in this paper have been derived from an analysis of a case study, i.e., analytics using data made available by the OECD. The set of data the OECD provides is vast and is used broadly. The argument is structured as follows. First, current issues and topics shaping the debate on blockchain are outlined. Then, a redefinition of the main artifacts on which some simple or convoluted analytic results are based is revised for some concrete purposes. The requirements on provenance, trust and repeatability are discussed with regards to the architecture proposed, and a proof of concept using smart contracts is used for reasoning on relevant scenarios. Findings: A combination of decentralized file systems and an open blockchain such as Ethereum supporting smart contracts can ascertain that the set of artifacts used for the analytics is shared. This enables the sequence underlying the successive stages of research and/or policymaking to be preserved. This suggests that, in turn, and ex post, it becomes possible to test whether evidence supporting certain findings and/or policy decisions still hold. Moreover, unlike traditional databases, blockchain technology makes it possible that immutable records can be stored. This means that the artifacts can be used for further exploitation or repetition of results. In practical terms, the use of blockchain technology creates the opportunity to enhance the evidence-based approach to policy design and policy recommendations that the OECD fosters. That is, it might enable the stakeholders not only to use the data available in the OECD repositories but also to assess corrections to a given policy strategy or modify its scope. Research limitations/implications: Blockchains and related technologies are still maturing, and several questions related to their use and potential remain underexplored. Several issues require particular consideration in future research, including anonymity, scalability and stability of the data repository. This research took as example OECD data repositories, precisely to make the point that more research and more dialogue between the research and policymaking community is needed to embrace the challenges and opportunities blockchain technology generates. Several questions that this research prompts have not been addressed. For instance, the question of how the sharing economy concept for the specifics of the case could be employed in the context of blockchain has not been dealt with. Practical implications: The practical implications of the research presented here can be summarized in two ways. On the one hand, by suggesting how a combination of decentralized file systems and an open blockchain, such as Ethereum supporting smart contracts, can ascertain that artifacts are shared, this paper paves the way toward a discussion on how to make this approach and solution reality. The approach and architecture proposed in this paper would provide a way to increase the scope of the reuse of statistical data and results and thus would improve the effectiveness of decision making as well as the transparency of the evidence supporting policy. Social implications: Decentralizing analytic artifacts will add to existing open data practices an additional layer of benefits for different actors, including but not limited to policymakers, journalists, analysts and/or researchers without the need to establish centrally managed institutions. Moreover, due to the degree of decentralization and absence of a single-entry point, the vulnerability of data repositories to cyberthreats might be reduced. Simultaneously, by ensuring that artifacts derived from data based in those distributed depositories are made immutable therein, full reproducibility of conclusions concerning the data is possible. In the field of data-driven policymaking processes, it might allow policymakers to devise more accurate ways of addressing pressing issues and challenges. Originality/value: This paper offers the first blueprint of a form of sharing that complements open data practices with the decentralized approach of blockchain and decentralized file systems. The case of OECD data repositories is used to highlight that while data storing is important, the real added value of blockchain technology rests in the possible change on how we use the data and data sets in the repositories. It would eventually enable a more transparent and actionable approach to linking policy up with the supporting evidence. From a different angle, throughout the paper the case is made that rather than simply data, artifacts from conducted analyses should be made persistent in a blockchain. What is at stake is the full reproducibility of conclusions based on a given set of data, coupled with the possibility of ex post testing the validity of the assumptions and evidence underlying those conclusions.},

abstract = {A vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) can improve the flow of traffic to facilitate intelligent transportation and to provide convenient information services, where the goal is to provide self-organizing data transmission capabilities for vehicles on the road to enable applications, such as assisted vehicle driving and safety warnings. VANETs are affected by issues such as identity validity and message reliability when vehicle nodes share data with other nodes. The method used to allow the vehicle nodes to upload sensor data to a trusted center for storage is susceptible to security risks, such as malicious tampering and data leakage. To address these security challenges, we propose a data security sharing and storage system based on the consortium blockchain (DSSCB). This digital signature technique based on the nature of bilinear pairing for elliptic curves is used to ensure the reliability and integrity when transmitting data to a node. The emerging consortium blockchain technology provides a decentralized, secure, and reliable database, which is maintained by the entire network node. In DSSCB, smart contracts are used to limit the triggering conditions for preselected nodes when transmitting and storing data and for allocating data coins to vehicles that participate in the contribution of data. The security analysis and performance evaluations demonstrated that our DSSCB solution is more secure and reliable in terms of data sharing and storage. Compared with the traditional blockchain system, the time required to confirm the data block was reduced by nearly six times and the transmission efficiency was improved by 83.33%.},

abstract = {A blockchain as a trustworthy and secure decentralized and distributed network has been emerged for many applications such as in banking, finance, insurance, healthcare and business. Recently, many communities in blockchain networks want to deploy machine learning models to get meaningful knowledge from geographically distributed large-scale data owned by each participant. To run a learning model without data centralization, distributed machine learning (DML) for blockchain networks has been studied. While several works have been proposed, privacy and security have not been sufficiently addressed, and as we show later, there are vulnerabilities in the architecture and limitations in terms of efficiency. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving DML model for a permissioned blockchain to resolve the privacy, security, and performance issues in a systematic way. We develop a differentially private stochastic gradient descent method and an error-based aggregation rule as core primitives. Our model can treat any type of differentially private learning algorithm where non-deterministic functions should be defined. The proposed error-based aggregation rule is effective to prevent attacks by an adversarial node that tries to deteriorate the accuracy of DML models. Our experiment results show that our proposed model provides stronger resilience against adversarial attacks than other aggregation rules under a differentially private scenario. Finally, we show that our proposed model has high usability because it has low computational complexity and low transaction latency.},

abstract = {Cloud storage platforms promise a convenient way for users to share files and engage in collaborations, yet they require all files to have a single owner who unilaterally makes access control decisions. Existing clouds are, thus, agnostic to the notion of shared ownership. This can be a significant limitation in much collaboration because, for example, one owner can delete files and revoke access without consulting the other collaborators. In this paper, we first formally define a notion of shared ownership within a file access control model. We then propose two possible instantiations of our proposed shared ownership model. Our first solution, called Commune, relies on secure file dispersal and collusion-resistant secret sharing to ensure that all access grants in the cloud require the support of an agreed threshold of owners. As such, Commune can be used in existing clouds without modifications to the platforms. Our second solution, dubbed Comrade, leverages the blockchain technology in order to reach consensus on access control decision. Unlike Commune, Comrade requires that the cloud is able to translate access control decisions that reach consensus in the blockchain into storage access control rules, thus requiring minor modifications to existing clouds. We analyze the security of our proposals and compare/evaluate their performance through implementations using Amazon S3.},

abstract = {Basic safety message (BSM) are messages that contain core elements of a vehicle such as vehicle's size, position, speed, acceleration and others. BSM are lightweight messages that can be regularly broadcast by the vehicles to enable a variety of applications. On the other hand, event-driven message (EDM) are messages generated at the time of occurrence such as accidents or roads sliding and can contain much more heavy elements including pictures, audio or videos. Security, architecture and communication solutions for BSM use cases have been largely documented on in the literature contrary to EDM due to several concerns such as the variant size of EDM, the appropriate architecture along with latency, privacy and security. In this paper, we propose a secure and blockchain based EDM protocol for 5G enabled vehicular edge computing. To offer scalability and latency for the proposed scenario, we adopt a 5G cellular architecture due to its projected features compared to 4G tong-term evaluation (LTE) for vehicular communications. We consider edge computing to provide local processing of EDM that can improve the response time of public agencies (ambulances or rescue teams) that may intervene to the scene. We make use of lightweight multi-receiver signcryption scheme without pairing that offers low time consuming operations, security, privacy and access control. EDM records need to be kept into a distributed system which can guarantee reliability and auditability of EDM. To achieve this, we construct a private blockchain based on the edge nodes to store EDM records. The performance analysis of the proposed protocol confirms its efficiency.},

abstract = {While Internet of Things (IoT) technology has been widely recognized as an essential part of Smart Cities, it also brings new challenges in terms of privacy and security. Access control (AC) is among the top security concerns, which is critical in resource and information protection over IoT devices. Traditional access control approaches, like Access Control Lists (ACL), Role-based Access Control (RBAC) and Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC), are not able to provide a scalable, manageable and efficient mechanism to meet the requirements of IoT systems. Another weakness in today's AC is the centralized authorization server, which can cause a performance bottleneck or be the single point of failure. Inspired by the smart contract on top of a blockchain protocol, this paper proposes BlendCAC, which is a decentralized, federated capability-based AC mechanism to enable effective protection for devices, services and information in large-scale IoT systems. A federated capability-based delegation model (FCDM) is introduced to support hierarchical and multi-hop delegation. The mechanism for delegate authorization and revocation is explored. A robust identity-based capability token management strategy is proposed, which takes advantage of the smart contract for registration, propagation, and revocation of the access authorization. A proof-of-concept prototype has been implemented on both resources-constrained devices (i.e., Raspberry PI nodes) and more powerful computing devices (i.e., laptops) and tested on a local private blockchain network. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the BlendCAC to offer a decentralized, scalable, lightweight and fine-grained AC solution for IoT systems.},

Meanwhile, blockchain technology opens a new era of value exchange with trustless security among strangers. Its decentralized architecture and cryptography based data storage pattern bring light to vast application areas with high security and scalability requirements. In this work, we provide a general solution for intelligence application development on blockchain. Specifically, we propose a novel design of a smart agent inspired by the smart contract concept in the blockchain. Based on the proposed smart agents, a system architecture composed by smart agents is built supported by blockchain, where the agent network and blockchain network is overlapped. Then, a demonstration of the proposed architecture is designed in a case where private data required to be “properly protected” in a distributed manner. The implementation of the designed system is further conducted in the Ethereum development environment, showing the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed architecture in developing a secure distributed application.},

abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to address the problem of content immutability and integrity of online scientific periodicals on the sites of small publishers that can be violated not only by the external hack of the publisher's site but also by publisher's and author's misconduct or by submitting different versions of a periodical to different sites. Design/methodology/approach: The authors defined a list of requirements that verify online scientific publications immutability and integrity. Then, the authors analyzed existing projects and recently emerged information on security technologies and identified challenges met during the development and testing. The use of the public blockchain network Ethereum as a secure storage location for data was explained. Findings: The authors developed the method of checking online scientific periodicals for immutability and presented ecosystem architecture to control immutability and integrity of data. On the example of the online periodical “Istoriya”, it was demonstrated how the immutability of online scientific publication has been verified with the use of the public blockchain over a six-month period. First, operating results were evaluated; challenges hampering the implementation of the suggested ecosystem on Ethereum now were identified; and potential advantages of the suggested approach as compared to similar projects were discovered. Research limitations/implications: The considered prototype is not a ready-to-use system, but in future providing higher transparency and the development of general distributed ecosystem small publishers will have new opportunities for development given that the issues of scalability, reliability and operating speed on a public blockchain will be addressed. Introduction of the described ecosystem may even provoke some changes on such conservative market as that of publishing of academic papers. Originality/value: This research is one of the first attempts to expand digital object identifier technology with the use of additional verifications based on the data storage and search in the public blockchain. The suggested idea is the example of “blockchainified science” that was brought to implementation in a real online journal. This method has some advantages compared to Crossmark service.},

abstract = {Background: Timely sharing of electronic health records across providers, while ensuring data security and privacy, is essential for prompt care of cancer patients, as well as for the development of medical research and the enhancement of personalized medicine. Yet, it is not trivial to achieve efficient consent management, data exchange, and access-control policy enforcement, in particular, in decentralized settings, and given the gravity of the condition such as cancer. Using blockchain technology (BCT) has been recently advocated by research communities and gained momentum from the industry perspective. However, most of the proposed solutions are at the level of a prototype, and blockchain-based healthcare data management systems are not in place yet. Summary:This paper presents a systematic literature review, aiming to analyze the motivations, advantages, and limitations, as well as barriers and future challenges faced when applying the state-of-the-art distributed ledger technology in oncology. We then discuss its outcomes and propose the direction of the future research that can help to attain integration and adoption of the BCT for data-sharing, medical research, and the pharmaceutical supply chain in oncology, as well as in healthcare in general. Key Messages:BCT has the potential to enhance data-sharing (for primary care and medical research), as well as to attain optimization of the pharmaceutical supply chain by bringing properties such as transparency, traceability, and immutability to the applications. However, BCT itself cannot guarantee data privacy and security. Thus, it is never proposed as a stand-alone technology, but as a combined technology with cryptographic techniques. Regardless of the number of existing prototypes of blockchain-based healthcare systems, due to the existing barriers of the adoption (e.g., legal, social, and technological limitations), there is a lack of evaluation in real-world settings. Aiming to overcome these limitations, we propose future research directions that include design of the privacy-preserving hybrid data storage, interoperable infrastructures and architecture, and are compliant with the international laws and regulations.},

@article{Li_2020,
abstract = {As one of the most prevailing retail channels, E-commerce has nowadays facilitated retailers to sell goods to customers worldwide and tremendously increased the supply chain efficiency by removing most intermediate links. The broaden business scope and accelerated goods circulation, nevertheless, have generally led to capital shortages for retailers, especially small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Given the SMEs' difficulty in acquiring capital from financial institutions such as banks, logistics finance (LF) has emerged as an alternative, which is the combination of logistics and financial service. However, the frequent order fulfillment and diversity of pledges in E-commerce hinder SMEs in meeting LF's financing requirements. Furthermore, the current LF relies more on large and reputable third-party logistics (3PLs) to alleviate financing risks, which in turn raises the entry threshold for other 3PLs. Hence, this paper has proposed a blockchain-enabled logistics finance execution platform (BcLFEP) as an integrated solution to facilitate LF for E-commerce retail. A cross-layered architecture is proposed to organize and manage involved resources, workflows and decisions based on the object-oriented methodology (OOM). A hybrid finite state machine-based smart contract (HFSM-SC) is designed to associate and coordinate with all kinds of agents for LF operations throughout its lifecycle. Moreover, blockchain is integrated with agent technology to construct a blockchain-enabled multi-agent system (BcMAS), providing a trusted runtime environment to more autonomously and efficiently execute smart contract. Finally, a case study is conducted to implement BcLFEP-enabled dynamic pledge management for verification and evaluation.},

abstract = {Due to the proliferation of ICT during the last few decades, there is an exponential increase in the usage of various smart applications such as smart farming, smart healthcare, supply-chain & logistics, business, tourism and hospitality, energy management etc. However, for all the aforementioned applications, security and privacy are major concerns keeping in view of the usage of the open channel, i.e., Internet for data transfer. Although many security solutions and standards have been proposed over the years to enhance the security levels of aforementioned smart applications, but the existing solutions are either based upon the centralized architecture (having single point of failure) or having high computation and communication costs. Moreover, most of the existing security solutions have focussed only on few aspects and fail to address scalability, robustness, data storage, network latency, auditability, immutability, and traceability. To handle the aforementioned issues, blockchain technology can be one of the solutions. Motivated from these facts, in this paper, we present a systematic review of various blockchain-based solutions and their applicability in various Industry 4.0-based applications. Our contributions in this paper are in four fold. Firstly, we explored the current state-of-the-art solutions in the blockchain technology for the smart applications. Then, we illustrated the reference architecture used for the blockchain applicability in various Industry 4.0 applications. Then, merits and demerits of the traditional security solutions are also discussed in comparison to their countermeasures. Finally, we provided a comparison of existing blockchain-based security solutions using various parameters to provide deep insights to the readers about its applicability in various applications.},

Recent advancements in information technology and blockchain technology have revolutionized electronic healthcare research and industry. The innovation of miniaturized healthcare sensors for monitoring patient vital signs has improved and secured the human healthcare system. The increase in portable health devices has enhanced the quality of health-monitoring status both at an activity/fitness level for self-health tracking and at a medical level, providing more data to clinicians with potential for earlier diagnosis and guidance of treatment. When sharing personal medical information, data security and comfort are essential requirements for interaction with and collection of electronic medical records. However, it is hard for current systems to meet these requirements because they have inconsistent security policies and access control structures. The new solutions should be directed towards improving data access, and should be managed by the government in terms of privacy and security requirements to ensure the reliability of data for medical purposes. Blockchain paves the way for a revolution in the traditional pharmaceutical industry and benefits from unique features such as privacy and transparency of data. In this paper, we propose a novel platform for monitoring patient vital signs using smart contracts based on blockchain. The proposed system is designed and developed using hyperledger fabric, which is an enterprise-distributed ledger framework for developing blockchain-based applications. This approach provides several benefits to the patients, such as an extensive, immutable history log, and global access to medical information from anywhere at any time. The Libelium e-Health toolkit is used to acquire physiological data. The performance of the designed and developed system is evaluated in terms of transaction per second, transaction latency, and resource utilization using a standard benchmark tool known as Hyperledger Caliper. It is found that the proposed system outperforms the traditional health care system for monitoring patient data.},

abstract = {This paper discusses how to use blockchain tokens to represent real estate titles. Tokens on the blockchain as a technological concept is the closest solution to the legal concept of titles, because it provides for evidence of ownership and can be transferred from one address to another, while giving exclusive access to such an address to the owner. This paper contains the analysis of the concept of tokens in the context of its applicability to title rights on real estate. There is also a discussion of the outcomes of conducted interviews with professionals in the field of Computer Science, technologies, blockchain and smart contracts. Some critical mismatches were found: tokens are not able to satisfy current demand to manage title rights online. To develop a mature and sustainable electronic system, there are certain issues that need to be addressed: inheritance procedures, litigation, guardianship, delegation of rights and rights of third parties (liens and encumbrances) as well as the legal concept of bundle of rights (possession, disposition, enjoyment, etc.), which requires a strong mathematical model. During the abovementioned interviews, some weaknesses were found in the existing ideas of the use of the blockchain for real estate, mostly related to the undesirable centralization and issues with security. As the result of this research, it is obvious what needs to be developed is the concept of a high-level design of the technology, capable of managing title rights on the blockchain, which includes a three-level mechanism of (1) e-voting, which provides for a democratic implementation of governing algorithms; (2) Smart Laws, as the concept of high level “smart” algorithms that implement (by e-voting) existing laws related to property rights in a form of the program/protocol; and (3) smart contract templates which are based on the smart laws, that allow people to manage their title rights online.},

SDA can be efficiently retrained to adapt to large streams of data, and this property is used in this work to develop a technique for classification of arrhythmias in a patient-specific manner. This approach is particularly useful in continuous remote systems because they gather large amounts of data for longer periods of time. Blockchain is a decentralized distributed ledger which secures transactions with cryptography. It is proposed as an access control manager to securely store and access data required by the classifier during retraining in real-time from an external data storage. This work uses MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database and the results show an increased accuracy for Ventricular Ectopic Beats (VEB) (99.15%) and Supraventricular Ectopic Beats (SVEB) (98.55%), which is higher than the published results of deep networks that are not retrained.},

abstract = {The certified mail is a value-added service that is widely used in the paper world. However, the scientific community has not yet provided a solution for certified e-mail that has achieved widespread acceptance. This lack of a certified e-mail solution is not due to a lack of proposed approaches; because over the past 40 years, more than 100 protocols have been reported in journals and at conferences. The vast majority of these proposed protocols use a trusted third party (TTP) to achieve fairness. The few solutions without a TTP have not been successful due to their high computational and/or communication cost. Blockchain provides a new approach to develop the protocols without a TTP but without the prior drawbacks of the previous solutions without a TTP. Here, we present a new protocol for certified e-mail based on a blockchain without a conventional TTP that is integrated with the conventional e-mail infrastructure. The protocol is secure, efficient, and viable from a practical perspective.},

abstract = {Understanding and predicting the performance of big data applications running in the cloud or on-premises could help minimise the overall cost of operations and provide opportunities in efforts to identify performance bottlenecks. The complexity of the low-level internals of big data frameworks and the ubiquity of application and workload configuration parameters makes it challenging and expensive to come up with comprehensive performance modelling solutions. In this paper, instead of focusing on a wide range of configurable parameters, we studied the low-level internals of the MapReduce communication pattern and used a minimal set of performance drivers to develop a set of phase level parametric models for approximating the execution time of a given application on a given cluster. Models can be used to infer the performance of unseen applications and approximate their performance when an arbitrary dataset is used as input. Our approach is validated by running empirical experiments in two setups. On average, the error rate in both setups is ±10% from the measured values.},

abstract = {The idea of connecting physical things and cyber components to enable new and richer interactions is a key component in any smart space concept. One of the central challenges in these new smart spaces is the access control of data, services and things. In recent years, Distributed Ledger technology (DLT) like Blockchain Technology (BCT), emerged as the most promising solution for decentralized access management. Using capability-based access control, access to data/services/things is achieved by transferring tokens between the accounts of a distributed ledger. Managing how the access tokens are transferred is, of course, a major challenge. Within the IoT space, smart contracts are at the center of most of the proposals for DLT/BCT networks targeting access control. The main problem in using smart contracts as a means for checking if and what access token can be transferred from one account to another is their immutability and accessibility. Smart contracts and chain code are by design meant to be immutable since they represent a binding contract between parties. In addition, they need to be accessible since they are to be executed on many nodes. This allows an attacker to study them and design the attack in a manner that passes the rules of the smart contract/chain code. This paper focuses on the use of metadata as a more effective means to prevent attackers from gaining access to data/services/things in a smart living space.},

Particularly, we use Ethereum smart contracts to manage the IPFS network and the web hosting service. IPFS platform is used to store data and to host websites. All storage miner nodes on the IPFS network offer the pinning service to ensure that source codes of the websites and users' data are retained long-term. Moreover, these nodes also enable the interplanetary name space (IPNS) service for creating and updating mutable links to IPFS contents. TXT record is also used in the domain name system (DNS) to map domain names to IPNS addresses for hosted websites. For privacy-preserving data storage, websites need to be deployed an encryption algorithm. The proposed model that combines between the IPFS and blockchain networks to form a platform providing the decentralized web hosting service. Experiment illustrates building and hosting a web application on the IPFS network. Experimental results show that, compared to the traditional web hosting model, the hosted web application on the proposed platform ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability.},

abstract = {The widespread acceptance of data sharing has promoted the relevant research in both academia and industry. ''Data sharing'' is the process of interchanging data among multiple data sources in a controllable access manner. Any such system provides common functionality of storage and access; however, there are prominent differences in non-functionalities, such as self-control, transparency, cost-effectiveness, incentive, and auditing, which make data sharing in a dilemma. In this paper, we propose a distributed data sharing model based on blockchain technology: data owner publishes data with an additional control policy; data consumer inquires data with an access request; and consensus nodes evaluate the request and make decisions. After formalizing the system model, we discuss the procedure of data sharing, reputation management, and proposed solution. With the access control policy, price compensation, and reputation management mechanism, we achieve self-control and price balance in sharing data. Our model is equally a closed-loop control system that acts as a regulator of supervising its participants. The analyses and experimental results show, comparing with the existing sharing systems, that our model is practical and can spur agents to participate actively in sharing data.},

By leveraging these benefits, automation is brought about in the industries giving rise to the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). IoT is prone to several cyberattacks and needs challenging approaches to achieve the desired security. Moreover, with the emergence of IIoT, the security vulnerabilities posed by it are even more devastating. Therefore, in order to provide a guideline to researchers, this survey primarily attempts to classify the attacks based on the objects of vulnerability. Subsequently, each of the individual attacks is mapped to one or more layers of the generalized IoT/IIoT architecture followed by a discussion on the countermeasures proposed in literature. Some relevant real-life attacks for each of these categories are also discussed. We further discuss the countermeasures proposed for the most relevant security threats in IIoT. A case study on two of the most important industrial IoT applications is also highlighted. Next, we explore the challenges brought by the centralized IoT/IIoT architecture and how blockchain can effectively be used towards addressing such challenges. In this context, we also discuss in detail one IoT specific Blockchain design known as Tangle, its merits and demerits. We further highlight the most relevant Blockchain-based solutions provided in recent times to counter the challenges posed by the traditional cloud-centered applications. The blockchain-related solutions provided in the context of two of the most relevant applications for each of IoT and IIoT is also discussed. Subsequently, we design a taxonomy of the security research areas in IoT/IIoT along with their corresponding solutions. Finally, several open research directions relevant to the focus of this survey are identified.},

abstract = {As the use of Internet of Things (IoT) devices is increasing dramatically, it is necessary to provide a trustable framework when IoT data are stored and used inside or outside IoT devices. Blockchains and smart contracts provide solutions to construct trustable environments in data storage and access. Unfortunately, current blockchain technology only suits for situations that a small or medium amount of data is stored and used, but it has a very low performance when a large amount of data gathered by IoT devices needs to be stored and accessed. This paper proposes a three-layer blockchain-based trustable framework for IoT data storage and access. In the framework, users, roles, permissions, data objects, and their relationships are formally defined. Based on these definitions, smart contracts with role-based access control (RBAC) model are developed. Additionally, a snapshot mechanism is designed to collect IoT data in order of time stamps and put it into files stored in the inter-planetary file system (IPFS). We developed a prototype of supply chain tracing system on Ethereum and IPFS for feasibility verification and performance evaluation of the proposed framework. The framework not only guarantees data integrity in storing IoT data, but also ensures data confidentiality when the IoT data is used. Moreover, simulation results illustrate that the prototype system has high performances in time, space, and gas consumption.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Their mission is to turn our cities, transportation systems, buildings, homes, and bodies in smart environments. These environments will bring us more comfort, improve our performance, increase our profits, and take away time-consuming tasks. However, besides its great benefits, the IoT is also a big source of concerns, mainly because a good part of its devices will handle private and confidential information. Recently, cases of successful IoT invasions only worsen this scenario and show us that the today's adopted access control systems need to be replaced by more efficiently and secure ones. To overcome these access control problems, in this work, we present the ControlChain. The ControlChain is an access control authorization architecture that is heavily based on Blockchain technology. We also demonstrate the viability of the ControlChain through the E-ControlChain, a proof-of-concept developed to run over the Ethereum network. Our proposals follows the IoT tendency requirements and are user-transparent, user-friendly, fully decentralized, scalable, fault tolerant, and compatible with a wide range of today's access control models already used in the IoT.

abstract = {A smart contract is an electronic transaction protocol intended to digitally facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation and execution of the terms of an underlying legal contract designed to fulfil common contractual conditions comprising payments, legal obligations, and enforcement without third parties. Thus, by following the traditional perception, smart contracts target to reduce transaction costs including arbitration and enforcement costs by realising trackable and irreversible transactions by using blockchain technology for distributed databases. However, the potential of smart contracts goes far beyond cost reductions by facilitating the entrepreneurial collaboration of cross-organisational business-processes that are characteristic for smart supply chains. A closer look to existing or ongoing smart contract projects reveals that the majority of smart-contract applications in business life are linked to supply chain management, Internet of Things and Industry 4.0 solutions. The author participated in several EU projects related to transnational entrepreneurial networks and smart supply chains. Thus, the paper discusses the research question of how and to which extent smart contracting and blockchain technology can facilitate the implementation of collaborative business structures for sustainable entrepreneurial activities in smart supply chains. The research is based on expert interviews, surveys and case studies, which took place in the context of the EU projects with a focus on the Baltic Sea Region.},

Notable examples are DDoS attacks on Krebs on Security and DYN, which have been performed by IoT devices part of botnets. We take a first step towards detecting P2P botnets in IoT, by proposing AutoBotCatcher, whose design is driven by the consideration that bots of the same botnet frequently communicate with each other and form communities. As such, the purpose of AutoBotCatcher is to dynamically analyze communities of IoT devices, formed according to their network traffic flows, to detect botnets. AutoBotCatcher exploits a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) blockchain, as a state transition machine that allows collaboration of multiple parties without trust, in order to perform collaborative and dynamic botnet detection by collecting and auditing IoT devices' network traffic flows as blockchain transactions. In this paper, we focus on the design of the AutoBotCatcher by first defining the blockchain structure underlying AutoBot-Catcher, then discussing its components.},

abstract = {The proliferation of inter-connected devices in critical industries, such as healthcare and power grid, is changing the perception of what constitutes critical infrastructure. The rising interconnectedness of new critical industries is driven by the growing demand for seamless access to information as the world becomes more mobile and connected and as the Internet of Things (IoT) grows. Critical industries are essential to the foundation of today's society, and interruption of service in any of these sectors can reverberate through other sectors and even around the globe. In today's hyper-connected world, the critical infrastructure is more vulnerable than ever to cyber threats, whether state sponsored, criminal groups or individuals. As the number of interconnected devices increases, the number of potential access points for hackers to disrupt critical infrastructure grows. This new attack surface emerges from fundamental changes in the critical infrastructure of organizations technology systems. This paper aims to improve understanding the challenges to secure future digital infrastructure while it is still evolving. After introducing the infrastructure generating big data, the functionality-based fog architecture is defined. In addition, a comprehensive review of security requirements in fog-enabled IoT systems is presented. Then, an in-depth analysis of the fog computing security challenges and big data privacy and trust concerns in relation to fog-enabled IoT are given. We also discuss blockchain as a key enabler to address many security related issues in IoT and consider closely the complementary interrelationships between blockchain and fog computing. In this context, this work formalizes the task of securing big data and its scope, provides a taxonomy to categories threats to fog-based IoT systems, presents a comprehensive comparison of state-of-the-art contributions in the field according to their security service and recommends promising research directions for future investigations.},

abstract = {In Smart Cities, an era of technology and on-demand offerings, being able to have a signed contract in the least amount of time possible can significantly benefit business operations. This project focuses on the Document of Understanding (DOU) contract oriented to supply chain operations, which forms the basis for the relationship between a consumer service and the provider of that service. The sign off of this process is currently too long; opening an opportunity to apply Blockchain as a solution. For this task, we have used local resources, applying design thinking and agile practices to create a local Blockchain Ledger. Consequently, we created a proof of concept Blockchain demo, which holds the complete detailed history of the agreement, with immutable transactions and transparency, adding security and privacy of the participant's information. With this demo, we registered the time needed to have the DOU contract signed off by everyone involved in the process, and it was drastically improved. The innovative contribution of this project is the application of Blockchain to our business activities, improving business operations, and giving us a real-time view of all the information. As a result, when combining our work methods with the latest technology, we have all-around improvements in business operations. Now with a successful trial run of the application, we can confidently apply smart contracts in day to day activities in a Smart City; it can be replicated in other areas that manage sensitive information and financial reports.},

abstract = {Nowadays, we are surrounded by a large number of IoT (Internet of Things) devices and sensors. These devices are designed to make life easier and more comfortable. Blockchain technology, especially its mass application, is becoming a term number one. Adoption of blockchain into enterprise networks still has a few challenges that need to be tackled. Utilizing blockchain can bring increased security and efficiency of network maintenance. The key feature of the blockchain, immutability, brings resistance to unauthorized modifications. The whole history of device configuration changes is stored in the blockchain, hence recovery after incidents is very straightforward. This paper extends our previous studies. We are introducing an improved architecture for management and monitoring of IoT devices using a private blockchain. The majority of the system is built on a chaincode, which handles CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations as well as encryption and access control. Device configuration files are stored in the blockchain. When a modification occurs, the device downloads a new configuration in a simple manner. The chaincode receives notification whether setup was successful and this history is available for administrators. Our results show that such a system is possible and dissemination of configuration changes to IoT devices can be secured by the blockchain. The key novelty of our solution is a distributed management of configuration files of IoT devices in enterprise networks utilizing blockchain technology. This is essentially improving security and storage options for configurations in the blockchain.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

With so many information systems to access, people need to memorize hundreds of user names and passwords. As a result, they often forget their user names or passwords and have to go through a time-consuming and troublesome procedure to find them back. In this article, we propose a solution storing people's user names and passwords using block-chain in an encrypted format. When the user name or password for a particular website is lost, they can be accessible through the block chain. As a result, people do not need to memorize their user names and passwords for different websites any more. The password stored in the block-chain would not be compromised to any cyber-attacks because block-chain is immutable.},

The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), with its cyber-physical and distributed nature, creates newchallenges, that existing TM systems cannot adequately address, such as for example the need for noninteractive exclusive access enforcement. In the meantime, a line of thought in the research community is that Distributed Ledgers (DLs), like the one implemented by the Ethereum blockchain, can provide strong security guarantees for distributed access control. However, this approach has not yet been examined in a scientific, systematic manner, and has many pitfalls, with arguably the most important one being scalability. In this paper, we critically explore the shortcomings of existing solutions for trust management in distributed networks, pinpoint which of these shortcomings can be addressed by utilizing DLs, and offer a conceptual design for a scalable, secure TM system. Our design approaches the problem in three layers, namely a global, an intermediate group or shard layer, and a local layer, corresponding to the set of embedded devices behind an internet access point. We view our design as a novel first step, helping the community to produce more secure and realistic authorization solutions for the IoT, in the near future.},

Likewise, microservices are getting more and more popular in the latest years thanks to their properties, that allow teams to slice existing information systems into small and independent services that can be developed independently by different teams.A symmetric paradigm applies to smart contracts as well, which represent well defined, usually isolated, executable programs, typically implementing simple and autonomous tasks with a well defined purpose, which can be assumed as services provided by the Contract. In this work we analyze a concrete case study where the microservices architecture environment is replicated and implemented through an equivalent set of smart contracts, showing for the first time the feasibility of implementing a microservices-based system with smart contracts and how the two innovative paradigms match together.Results show that it is possible to implement a simple microservices-based system with smart contracts maintaining the same set of functionalities and results. The result could be highly beneficial in contexts such as smart voting, where not only the data integrity is fundamental but also the source code executed must be trustable.},

Attacks to data integrity are therefore of paramount importance, as essential organization decisions can be maliciously affected by manipulation of information. This problem is particularly true in cloud computing settings where information owners are unable to monitor basic information elements such as access control and physical data storage. Recently, Blockchain has appeared as an intriguing technology that offers convincing data integrity characteristics among others. In this paper, we design a blockchain-based cloud architecture, focusing the threats of data integrity. We propose a methodology in peer to peer cloud storage to verify integrity based on blockchain, making checking more transparent, open, and publicly available. In this framework, we confirm the data integrity by using merkle trees and design a smart contract for the authentication process. Furthermore, we present an elementary model of an e□icient blockchain structure for cloud computing settings. Thus, this methodology helps in enhancing the security and integrity of the cloud storage system.},

abstract = {Personal data sharing with service providers represents an unavoidable risk, due to issues like: improper data treatment, lack of users' awareness to whom they are sharing with, wrong or excessive data sharing from end users who ignore that they are exposing personal information. But sharing personal information, in the IoT era forces us to consider not only personal data, but also personal devices sharing. It becomes fundamental to consider users' awareness and centrality in the act of sharing, and resilience towards malicious third parties, which are problems that blockchain technologies are fit to solve. In order to make decentralized solutions usable for real, there is another challenge, the not simple compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the European Authority has provided, in order to implement protection of sensitive data in each EU member. Such regulation protects sensible data throughout certification mechanisms (according to Art. 42 GDPR), which is a mandatory requirement for any service which may come in contact with sensitive data. The current paper offers a contribution, showing that the decentralized approach for personal data sharing, may be compliant not only with the requirement of users' centrality but also with GDPR, representing a novelty for IoT-ready personal data sharing management systems based on a distributed environment. This is possible by embedding the consent mechanism described by GDPR, within a real decentralized prototype developed to share personal data and devices. We present our approach and an architectural blueprint which evolves the prototype.},

abstract = {Blockchain can be used to ensure trust in a decentralized environment in which no trusted authority is available. Its original idea is to collect transactions in a block, and to chain the blocks together in such a way that attackers cannot forge the chain if the majority of the network is honest. Since its creation in 2008, blockchain technology has been used broadly in Internet to support decentralized payments, cloud computing, publishing, etc. This work focuses on public permissionless blockchain which neither guards against bad actors nor enforces access control. Named data networking (NDN) uses name-based routing and in-networking caching to support efficient content delivery, making it a promising future Internet architecture as well as a great network technology which can improve blockchain data delivery. Therefore, it is a very necessary task to enable deployment of blockchain applications over NDN. However, NDN is not immediately compatible with typical blockchain, since (permissionless) blockchain applications usually require broadcasting transactions and blocks in real time, which is not supported by the "pull" design of NDN. In this work, we propose BoNDN which enables blockchain applications over NDN. Unlike previous work, BoNDN follows the core design of NDN. We treat each type of blockchain data needed to be broadcast individually. Specifically, we rely on Interest broadcasting to support real-time broadcasting of blockchain transactions, which is small in size and can be brought by an Interest packet. In addition, we propose a subscription-push approach to support broadcasting of blockchain blocks, in which each miner performs subscription, and once a block is generated, the subscribed miner will receive the block.},

Furthermore, this paper builds upon the idealised agent algorithm model presented in the companion paper to include non-ideal conditions such as network losses, component losses, blockchain fees and Distribution Network Service Provider (DNSP) fees. The simulation results contained here-within verify the hypothesis predicted within the companion paper - the hierarchical scaling of the transactive energy market may reduce the market fluctuations (magnitude and frequency) due to increased competition and availability of supply.

Data transmission between vehicles uses a peer-to-peer network in which every node communicates directly with every other node, verified by their relevant end-point nodes; lane's acquisition right is approved by all relevant vehicle nodes, as well as with consensus agreed upon via smart contract.},

abstract = {Surveys indicate that users are often afraid to entrust data to cloud storage providers, because these do not offer sufficient privacy. On the other hand, peer-2-peer-based privacy-preserving storage systems like Freenet suffer from a lack of contribution and storage capacity, since there is basically no incentive to contribute own storage capacity to other participants in the network. We address these contradicting requirements by a design which combines a distributed storage with a privacy-preserving blockchain-based payment system to create incentives for participation while maintaining user privacy. By following a Privacy-by-Design strategy integrating privacy throughout the whole system life cycle, we show that it is possible to achieve levels of privacy comparable to state-of-the-art distributed storage technologies, despite integrating a payment mechanism. Our results show that it is possible to combine storage contracts and payments in a privacy-preserving way. Further, our system design may serve as an inspiration for future similar architectures.},

abstract = {Due to the offering of many benefits, blockchain is a useful environment to build many applications in multiple fields such as cryptocurrency, Internet of Things (IoT), mobile applications and healthcare industry. However, it has a problem in ensuring the privacy of user data due to its public nature. Data on a blockchain is public and can reveal someone's personal data or transactions. Many applications that venture in blockchain such as financial applications, Internet of Things (IoT) and healthcare applications can fall victim to revelation of personal data and linking attack. Many solutions such as automated access-control protocol that does not require a third party, a local miner operating in a local private blockchain that enforces users' access control policy, a cryptographic protocol that lets contractual parties interact by using zero-knowledge proof, and computation of data query in a distributed way by using secure multi-party computation have been proposed to tackle this privacy issue in using blockchain. Hence, this paper provides a review on the current solutions that addresses the privacy issues of blockchain in different platforms. However, these solutions have some limitations that cannot be overlooked and proper measures must be taken to make blockchain to be able to better protect the privacy of its users. This paper also discusses the limitations of the solutions and looks into the aspects that need to be addressed.},

abstract = {The modern intelligent transportation system brings not only new opportunities for vehicular Internet of Things (IoT) services but also new challenges for vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs). Apart from enhanced network performance, a practical and reliable security scheme is needed to handle the trust management while preserving user privacy at the same time. The emerging 5G mobile communication system is viewed as a prominent technology for ultra-reliable, low-latency wireless communication services. Furthermore, incorporating software-defined network (SDN) architecture into the 5G-VANET enables global information gathering and network control. Hence, real-time IoT services on transportation monitoring and reporting can be well supported. Both pave the way for an innovative vehicular security scheme. This paper investigates the security and privacy issue in the transportation system and the vehicular IoT environment in SDN-enabled 5G-VANET. Due to the decentralized and immutable characteristics of blockchain, a blockchain-based security framework is designed to support the vehicular IoT services, i.e., real-time cloud-based video report and trust management on vehicular messages. This paper explicitly illustrates the SDN-enabled 5G-VANET model and the scheduling procedures of the blockchain-based framework. The numerical simulation results also show that malicious vehicular nodes or messages can be well detected while the overhead and impact on the network performance are acceptable for large-scale scenarios. Through case studies and theoretical analysis, we demonstrate our design substantially guarantees a secure and trustworthy vehicular IoT environment with user privacy preserved.},

This paper proposes a novel ETS model customised for Industry 4.0 integration. It incorporates blockchain technology to address ETS's management and fraud issues whilst it utilizes a reputation system in a new approach to improve ETS efficacy. Specific design of how the blockchain technology and reputation system are used to achieve these objectives is showed within this paper. The case study demonstrates the inner working of reputation-based trading system—in which reputation signifies participants performance and commitment toward emission reduction effort. Multi-criteria analysis is used to evaluate the proposed scheme against conventional ETS model. The result shows that the proposed model is a feasible scheme and that the benefits of its implementation will outweigh its drawback.},

@article{Lemieux_2020,
abstract = {Purpose: Distributed trust technologies, such as blockchain, propose to permit peer-to-peer transactions without trusted third parties. Yet not all implementations of such technologies fully decentralize. Information professionals make strategic choices about the level of decentralization when implementing such solutions, and many organizations are taking a hybrid (i.e. partially decentralized) approach to the implementation of distributed trust technologies. This paper conjectures that while hybrid approaches may resolve some challenges of decentralizing information governance, they also introduce others. To better understand these challenges, this paper aims first to elaborate a framework that conceptualizes a centralized–decentralized information governance continuum along three distinct dimensions: custody, ownership and right to access data. This paper then applies this framework to two illustrative blockchain case studies – a pilot Brazilian land transfer recording solution and a Canadian health data consent sharing project – to exemplify how the current transition state of blockchain pilots straddles both the old (centralized) and new (decentralized) worlds. Finally, this paper outlines the novel challenges that hybrid approaches introduce for information governance and what information professionals should do to navigate this thorny transition period. Counterintuitively, it may be much better for information professionals to embrace decentralization when implementing distributed trust technologies, as hybrid models could offer the worst of both the centralized and future decentralized worlds when consideration is given to the balance between information governance risks and new strategic business opportunities. Design/methodology/approach: This paper illustrates how blockchain is transforming organizations and societies by highlighting new strategic information governance challenges using our original analytic framework in two detailed blockchain case studies – a pilot solution in Brazil to record land transfers (Flores et al., 2018) and another in Canada to handle health data sharing consent (Hofman et al., 2018). The two case studies represent research output of the first phase of an ongoing multidisciplinary research project focused on gaining an understanding of how blockchain technology generates organizational, societal and data transformations and challenges. The analytic framework was developed inductively from a thematic synthesis of the findings of the case studies conducted under the auspices of this research project. Each case discussed in detail in this paper was chosen from among the project's case studies, as it represents a desire to move away from the old centralized world of information governance to a new decentralized one. However, each case study also represents and embodies a transition state between the old and new worlds and highlights many of the associated strategic information governance challenges. Findings: Decentralization continues to disrupt organizations and societies. New emerging distributed trust technologies such as blockchain break the old rules with respect to the trust and authority structures of organizations and how records and data are created, managed and used. While governments and businesses around the world clearly see value in this technology to drive business efficiency, open up new market opportunities and create new forms of value, these advantages will not come without challenges. For information executives then, the question is not if they will be disrupted, but how. Understanding the how as will be discussed in this paper provides the business know how to leverage the incredible innovation and transformation that decentralized trust technology enables before being leapfrogged by another organization. It requires a change of mindset to consider an organization as one part of a broader ecosystem, and for those who successfully do so, this paper views this as a strategic opportunity for those responsible for strategic information governance to design the future instead of being disrupted by it. Research limitations/implications: This paper presents a novel analytic framework for strategic information governance challenges as we transition from a traditional world of centralized records and information management to a new decentralized world. This paper analyzes these transitions and their implications for strategic information governance along three trajectories: custody, ownership and right to access records and data, illustrating with reference to our case studies. Practical implications: This paper predicts a large number of organizations will miss the opportunities of the new decentralized trust world, resulting in a rather major churning of organizations, as those who successfully participate in building the new model will outcompete those stuck in the old world or the extremely problematic hybrid transition state. Counterintuitively, this paper argues that it may be much less complex for information executives to embrace decentralization as fast as they can, as in some ways the hybrid model seems to offer the worst of both the centralized and future decentralized worlds with respect to information governance risks. Social implications: This paper anticipates broader societal consequences of the predicted organization churn, in particular with respect to uncertainty about the evidence that records provide for public accountability and contractual rights and entitlements. Originality/value: Decentralized trust technologies, such as blockchain, permit peer-to-peer transactions without trusted third parties. Of course, such radical shifts do not happen overnight. The current transition state of blockchain pilots straddles both the old and new worlds. This paper presents a theoretical framework categorizing strategic information governance challenges on a spectrum of centralized to decentralized in three primary areas: custody, ownership and right to access records and data. To illustrate how decentralized trust is transforming organizations and societies, this paper presents these strategic information governance challenges in two blockchain case studies – a pilot Brazilian land transfer recording solution and a Canadian health data consent sharing project. Drawing on the theoretical framework and case studies, this paper outlines what information executives should do to navigate this thorny transition period.},

abstract = {Blockchain is a developing technology that can be utilized for secure data storage and sharing. In this work, we examine the cost of Blockchain-based data storage for constrained Internet of Things (IoT) devices. We had two phases in the study. In the first phase, we stored data retrieved from a temperature/humidity sensor connected to an Ethereum testnet blockchain using smart contracts in two different ways: first, appending the new data to the existing data, storing all sensor data; and second, overwriting the new data onto the existing data, storing only a recent portion of the data. In the second phase, we stored simulated data from several sensors on the blockchain assuming sensor data is numeric. We proposed a method for encoding the data from the sensors in one variable and compared the costs of storing the data in an array versus storing the encoded data from all sensors in one variable. We also compared the costs of carrying out the encoding within the smart contract versus outside the smart contract. In the first phase, our results indicate that overwriting data points is more cost-efficient than appending them. In the second phase, using the proposed encoding method to store the data from several sensors costs significantly less than storing the data in an array, if the encoding is done outside the smart contract. If the encoding is carried out in the smart contract, the cost is still less than storing the data in an array, however, the difference is not significant. The study shows that even though expensive, for applications where the integrity and transparency of data are crucial, storing IoT sensor data on Ethereum could be a reliable solution.},

abstract = {The revolution of Internet-of-vehicles (IoV) has stimulated a substantial response from academia, research, and industry due to its massive potential to improve overall transportation. Current IoV faces huge challenges due to its reliance on IP-based network architecture. Therefore, named data networking (NDN) is proposed as a promising architecture to solve issues posed by IP-based systems. Recently, blockchains (BCs) have been utilized within IoV to increase network security. However, the integration of BC within NDN-enabled IoV is still an open research problem. In this study, we proposed a novel tier-based architecture known as Blockchain in NDN-enabled Internet-of-vehicles (BINDN), which can support BC within NDN-enabled IoV. BINDN can be used as reference architecture to design security solutions in NDN-enabled IoV using BC. Furthermore, it provides an extensive set of applications including IoV security, trust management, and privacy enhancements. Moreover, we highlighted major challenges and issues when integrating BC within NDN-enabled IoV.},

abstract = {Used mainly for the virtual money, the Blockchain technology adopts a decentralized network of peers to ensure a secure and transparent information storage and transmission. The basic use of Blockchain can be bypassed, and it is interesting to integrate it into other fields such as the Cloud storage. Cloud storage solutions ensure a continuous data synchronization and guarantee data sharing between different users. However, sharing user side encrypted data raises key and access control management challenges. Within this paper, we propose a novel access control model called Timely CP-ABE. Two main features come with our model. First, we introduce a decentralized access control mechanism where the user legitimacy is verified by Blockchain nodes. Second, we add temporal dimension to file sharing based on CP-ABE. In fact, we introduce a validity time to the access authorization without additional revocation cost. As a proof of concept, the implementation of the Timely CP-ABE based on Blockchain is performed on the CP-ABE toolkit and Multichain solution.},

abstract = {Managing sensitive data in shared environments such as public clouds is an enduring challenge. While several approaches exist to protect data at rest such as end-to-end encryption, there exist only a few solutions such as homomorphic encryption that offer secure data processing. Unfortunately, these solutions cannot be used in practice as they incur non-negligible run-time overheads and security risks. Moreover, as the majority of data management systems were designed to operate in private cloud environments, which are under the control of the data owner, they often lack appropriate mechanisms for access control as well as privacy assurance. In this paper we propose Vallum, a data access and protection layer that closes these gaps while enabling users to operate data management systems in shared environments such securely as public clouds. Vallum utilizes Intel SGX and remote attestation to ensure confidentiality and integrity of the data being stored and processed. Furthermore, it provides access protection and privacy assurance through a extensible architecture. Our performance evaluation indicates that the overhead introduced by Vallum makes it viable to be deployed in cloud infrastructures.},

abstract = {To make good use of valuable Internet of Things (IoT) data assets, this paper proposes a trust-aware IoT data economic system (TIDES) with complete IoT data pricing, trading and protection functions. To ensure reliable and automatic data trading, the entire trading process is automatically performed by smart contracts on a hierarchical blockchain. Moreover, we develop several sophisticated methods to ensure the efficiency and service quality of TIDES. First, a complete evaluation model that takes the data trading profile and reputation into consideration is proposed for both suppliers and demanders to assess the trustworthiness of their trading partners. Second, a client-centric data value evaluation model and a game-theory-based pricing model are used to promote win-win transactions in which the demanders obtain higher quality data at an acceptable price and the suppliers receive higher profits. Third, a dispute arbitration model is invoked to detect suspicious trading and refund these payments automatically. TIDES further utilizes a multi-access edge computing (MEC) architecture to alleviate the huge burdens of IoT devices from blockchain operations, reduce the trading latency, and help mobile devices to trade IoT data. The simulation results have shown the advantages of TIDES in terms of trading time, storage overhead, data trading profit, quality data trading, pricing efficiency, and reliability on data asset management and trading.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based data sharing mechanism for Vehicular Network. We introduce edge service providers placed near to ordinary vehicle nodes to fulfill their requests. Smart vehicles generate a huge amount of data which is stored in the Interplanetary File System (IPFS). IPFS is a distributed file storage system that overcomes the limitations of centralized architecture. Monetary incentive is given to edge vehicle nodes for providing services to ordinary nodes. Ordinary nodes give reviews against services provided by the edge nodes that are stored in a blockchain. A smart contract is used to automate system processes without third party involvement and checking reviews of the edge node. To optimize gas consumption, we used Proof of Authority (PoA) as a consensus mechanism for transaction validation. PoA enhances overall system performance and optimized gas consumption. The caching server is introduced to store frequently used services in memory and provided to ordinary vehicles upon request. Moreover, we have used symmetric key cryptographic mechanism which ensures data security and privacy. A trust management system is proposed, which ensures the reputation of nodes. The trust value is stored in a blockchain, which determines the authenticity of nodes involved in a network. From simulation results, it is shown that our proposed system is efficient for the vehicular network.},

abstract = {Edge computing is a promising approach for provisioning distributed cloud services to Internet of Things (IoT) systems. Many recent studies propose that edge nodes use blockchain for the decentralized management and access control of IoT data. However, due to the massive volume of data and related transactions, edge servers will eventually run out of space to store the full chain. We introduce scalable and lightweight architecture called LiTiChain, a blockchain of blocks with finite lifetime. In LiTiChain, outdated transactions and blocks, that is, the blocks whose lifetimes are expired, can be safely removed from the chain. Two graphs are merged into the structure of LiTiChain: 1) a tree representing the order of expiry of lifetimes and 2) a linear graph representing the order of block creation. We show that this construction not only ensures the connectivity of the chain after block deletions but also helps to maintain the block height of shortened chain. LiTiChain also supports transactions whose lifetime is unknown at the time of creation. It is possible that some expired blocks need to be retained in the chain, in case they are needed to validate remaining blocks, which incurs additional storage costs. A detailed analysis of such overhead in storage costs is presented for stochastic and worst case scenarios. Extensive simulation is performed on actual and synthetic IoT data so as to gain insights on the storage costs under various lifetime distributions. It is demonstrated that LiTiChain provides a simple yet effective solution to scalability problems in storing blockchains for the IoT ecosystems.},

For this feature, we apply blockchain technology to the design of access control schemes. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based access control scheme that is suitable for multiple scenarios in the smart grid. Our access control scheme is based on an identity-based combined encryption, signature and signcryption scheme. In addition, we design a consensus algorithm in the power system for the consortium blockchain architecture to solve the key escrow problem of the untrusted third parties. Our scheme also ensures the confidentiality, integrity, authentication and non-repudiation of the data. Compared with the existing work, our scheme can use the same key pair to encrypt, sign and signcrypt the message, which has lower computation and communication costs in multiple scenarios of smart grids.},

abstract = {Despite the advantages that the Internet of Things (IoT) will bring to our daily life, the increasing interconnectivity, as well as the amount and sensitivity of data, make IoT devices an attractive target for attackers. To address this issue, the recent Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) standard has been proposed to describe network access control policies in the manufacturing phase to protect the device during its operation by restricting its communications. In this paper, we define an architecture and process to obtain and enforce the MUD restrictions during the bootstrapping of a device. Furthermore, we extend the MUD model with a flexible policy language to express additional aspects, such as data privacy, channel protection, and resource authorization. For the enforcement of such enriched behavioral profiles, we make use of Software Defined Networking (SDN) techniques, as well as an attribute-based access control approach by using authorization credentials and encryption techniques. These techniques are used to protect devices' data, which are shared through a blockchain platform. The resulting approach was implemented and evaluated in a real scenario, and is intended to reduce the attack surface of IoT deployments by restricting devices' communication before they join a certain network.},

abstract = {The end of Moore's law has been proclaimed on many occasions and it's probably safe to say that we are now working in the post-Moore era. But no one is ready to slow down just yet. We can view Gordon Moore's observation on transistor densification as just one aspect of a longer-term underlying technological trend - the Law of Accelerating Returns articulated by Kurzweil. Arguably, companies became somewhat complacent in the Moore era, happy to settle for the gains brought by each new process node. Although we can expect scaling to continue, albeit at a slower pace, the end of Moore's Law delivers a stronger incentive to push other trends of technology progress harder. Some exciting new technologies are now emerging such as multichip 3D integration and the introduction of new technologies such as storage-class memory and silicon photonics. Moreover, we are also entering a golden age of computer architecture innovation. One of the key drivers is the pursuit of domain-specific architectures as proclaimed by Turing award winners John Hennessy and David Patterson. A good example is the Xilinx's AI Engine, one of the important features of the Versal™ ACAP (adaptive compute acceleration platform) [1]. Today, the explosion of AI workloads is one of the most powerful drivers shifting our attention to find faster ways of moving data into, across, and out of accelerators. Features such as massive parallel processing elements, the use of domain specific accelerators, the dense interconnect between distributed on-chip memories and processing elements, are examples of the ways chip makers are looking beyond scaling to achieve next-generation performance gains. Next, the growing demands of scaling-out hyperscale datacenter applications drive much of the new architecture developments. Given a high diversification of workloads that invoke massive compute and data movement, datacenter architectures are moving away from rigid CPU-centric structures and instead prioritize adaptability and configurability to optimize resources such as memory and connectivity of accelerators assigned to individual workloads. There is no longer a single figure of merit. It's not all about Tera-OPS. Other metrics such as transfers-per-second and latency come to the fore as demands become more real-time; autonomous vehicles being an obvious and important example. Moreover, the transition to 5G will result in solutions that operate across the traditional boundaries between the cloud and edge and embedded platforms that are obviously power-conscious and cost-sensitive. Future workloads will require agile software flows that accommodate the spread of functions across edge and cloud. Another industry megatrend that will drive technology requirements especially in encryption, data storage and communication, is Blockchain. To some, it may already have a bad reputation, tarnished by association with the anarchy of cryptocurrency, but it will be more widely relevant than many of us realize. Who could have foreseen the development of today's Internet when ARPANET first appeared as a simple platform for distributed computing and sending email? Through projects such as the open-source Hyperledger, Blockchain technology could be game-changing as a platform for building trust in transactions executed over the Internet. We may soon be talking in terms of the Trusted Internet. The predictability of Moore's law may have become rather too comfortable and slow. The future requires maximizing the flexibility, agility, and efficiency of new technologies. With Moore's Law now mostly behind us, new adaptable and scalable architectures will allow us to further provide exponential return from technology in order to create a more adaptable and intelligent world.},

Blockchain is a novel technology, which has gained a lot of attention in the last years, mainly due to its use as a backbone for cryptocurrencies. The main purpose of blockchain technology is to provide anonymous transactions between participants, over a peer-to-peer network, using a decentralized distributed ledger. The goal of this novel approach is to eliminate any 3rd party validation and replace the trust of a central authority for transaction validation with cryptographic proof. While most applications of the blockchain revolve around cryptocurrencies, the blockchain can be used in many other fields, such as finance, distributed data storage, health and medicine, automation, etc. By creating an open, decentralized network, the blockchain can be used to develop decentralized applications and enable data access and sharing on a much higher level than the common implementations of client-server architectures which are in use today. In this paper, we will present a proof of concept method for field devices to store and share data using a distributed ledger built on the IOTA tangle, as well as provide means of access to the data which can be used in IoT and decentralized applications.},

abstract = {Electronic health record sharing can help to improve the accuracy of diagnosis, where security and privacy preservation are critical issues in the systems. In recent years, blockchain has been proposed to be a promising solution to achieve personal health information (PHI) sharing with security and privacy preservation due to its advantages of immutability. This work proposes a blockchain-based secure and privacy-preserving PHI sharing (BSPP) scheme for diagnosis improvements in e-Health systems. Firstly, two kinds of blockchains, private blockchain and consortium blockchain, are constructed by devising their data structures, and consensus mechanisms. The private blockchain is responsible for storing the PHI while the consortium blockchain keeps records of the secure indexes of the PHI. In order to achieve data security, access control, privacy preservation and secure search, all the data including the PHI, keywords and the patients' identity are public key encrypted with keyword search. Furthermore, the block generators are required to provide proof of conformance for adding new blocks to the blockchains, which guarantees the system availability. Security analysis demonstrates that the proposed protocol can meet with the security goals. Furthermor, we implement the proposed scheme on JUICE to evaluate the performance.},

abstract = {The underlying fundaments of blockchain are cryptography and cryptographic concepts that provide reliable and secure decentralized solutions. Although many recent papers study the use-cases of blockchain in different industrial areas, such as finance, health care, legal relations, IoT, information security, and consensus building systems, only few studies scrutinize the cryptographic concepts used in blockchain. To the best of our knowledge, there is no Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) that gives a complete picture of the existing cryptographic concepts which have been deployed or have the potential to be deployed in blockchain. In this paper, we thoroughly review and systematize all cryptographic concepts which are already used in blockchain. Additionally, we give a list of cryptographic concepts which have not yet been applied but have big potentials to improve the current blockchain solutions. We also include possible instantiations of these cryptographic concepts in the blockchain domain. Last but not least, we explicitly postulate 21 challenging problems that cryptographers interested in blockchain can work on.},

abstract = {Smart contracts, which are widely recognized as key components of blockchain technology, enable automatic execution of agreements. Since each smart contract is a computer program that autonomously runs on a blockchain platform, their development requires much effort and care compared with the development of more common programs. In this paper, we propose a technique to automatically generate a smart contract from a human-understandable contract document that is created using a document template and a controlled natural language (CNL). The automation is based on a mapping from the document template and the CNL to a formal model that can define the terms and conditions in a contract including temporal constraints and procedures. The formal model is then translated into an executable smart contract. We implemented a toolchain that generates smart contracts of Hyperledger Fabric from template-based contract documents via a formal model. We then evaluated the feasibility of our approach through case studies of two types of real-world contracts in different domains.},

abstract = {Enabled by mobile and wearable technology, personal health data delivers immense and increasing value for healthcare, benefiting both care providers and medical research. The secure and convenient sharing of personal health data is crucial to the improvement of the interaction and collaboration of the healthcare industry. Faced with the potential privacy issues and vulnerabilities existing in current personal health data storage and sharing systems, as well as the blockchain integration concerns summarized in this paper, an innovative user-centric health data sharing solution by utilizing a decentralized but permissioned blockchain is proposed to protect privacy and enhance access management, with the help of channel formation scheme supported by the blockchain. By developing a web application for Personal Health Data Management (PHDM) systems, the individuals are capable of synchronizing sensor data from wearable devices with online account and controlling data access from any third parties. A mobile application is deployed to collect health data from personal wearable devices, manual input, and medical devices, and synchronize data to the cloud for data sharing with healthcare providers and health insurance companies. To preserve the integrity of health data, a proof of integrity and validation, is made available to each record, which is permanently retrievable from cloud database and is anchored to the blockchain network. Moreover, for scalable and performance considerations, a tree-based data processing and batching method is adopted to deal with large data sets of personal health data collected and uploaded by the mobile platform. To enable a trusted data access record, the Intel Software Extensions technology is utilized to ensure the accountability for data access and token based access control scheme is enhanced with the trusted hardware. Analysis shows that the proposed approach provides user privacy and accountability with acceptable overhead and scalability.},

Healthcare sector can become an application domain of blockchain as it can be used to securely store health records and maintain an immutable version of truth. Blockchain technology is originally built on Hyperledger, which is a decentralized platform to enable secure, unambiguous and swift transactions and usage of medical records for various purposes. The paper proposes to use blockchain technology to provide a common and secured platform through which medical data can be accessed by doctors, medical practitioners, pharma and insurance companies. In order to provide secured access to such sensitive data, blockchain ensures that any organization or person can only access data with consent of the patient. The Hyperledger Fabric architecture guarantees that the data is safe and private by permitting the patients to grant multi-level access to their data. Apart from blockchain technology, machine learning can be used in the healthcare sector to understand and analyze patterns and gain insights from data. As blockchain can be used to provide secured and authenticated data, machine learning can be used to analyze the provided data and establish new boundaries by applying various machine learning techniques on such real-time medical data.},

However, how much a company needs to afford to keep this improved availability? As an additional activity, this paper compares the obtained availability values with the infrastructure deployment expenses and establishes a cost × benefit relationship.

This paper proposes and evaluate four different infrastructures hosting blockchains: (i) baseline; (ii) double redundant; (iii) triple redundant, and (iv) hyper-converged.

abstract = {As of today, web-based social communication platforms, such as WhatsApp, Twitter, or Facebook, are almost exclusively realized via centralized platforms, based on proprietary interfaces, protocols, and data formats. In consequence, even though social communication being a decentralized, peer-to-peer phenomenon, web-based communication today is implemented via closed, proprietary data silos, which not only lock-in users into their service platforms, but also control and own exchange information and data, including personal and sensitive data such as photos, messages, or contact information. In this paper we present Tawki, a decentralized service architecture for social communication. Using Tawki, users remain in full control of their personal data, which is stored and managed by personal data storages. Each data storage is accessible via a unified Tawki API, which allows users to send and request data to and from other users' personal data storages. Following this approach, social communication is again peer-to-peer without involving a third party controlling and monitoring the process. Tawki uses the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) for both the management of user identities and resolving identifiers to the respective user's personal storage location. Leveraging the immutability of the Ethereum Blockchain, identity management and discovery of personal data storages is secured against censorship and control through any third party.},

To enhance SSA, the dynamic data-driven applications systems (DDDAS) framework couples on-line data with off-line models to enhance system performance. Using feedback control, sensor management, and communications reliability. For information management, there is a need for identity authentication and access control to ensure the integrity of exchanged data as well as to grant authorized entities access right to data and services. Due to decentralization and heterogeneity of SSA systems, it is challenging to build an efficient centralized access control system, which could either be a performance bottleneck or the single point of failure. Inspired by the blockchain and smart contract technology, this paper introduces BlendCAC, a decentralized authentication and capability-based access control mechanism to enable effective protection for devices, services and information in SSA networks. To achieve secure identity authentication, the BlendCAC leverages the blockchain to create virtual trust zones and a robust identity-based capability token management strategy is proposed. A proof-of-concept prototype has been implemented on both resources-constrained devices and more powerful computing devices, and is tested on a private Ethereum blockchain network. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the BlendCAC scheme to offer a decentralized, scalable, lightweight and fine-grained access control solution for space system towards SSA.},

Since blockchain technologies are at an early stage, there is a lack of a systematic and holistic view on designing software systems that use blockchain. We view blockchain as part of a bigger system, which requires patterns for using blockchain in the design of their software architecture. In this paper, we collect a list of patterns for blockchain-based applications. The pattern collection is categorized into four types, including interaction with external world patterns, data management patterns, security patterns and contract structural patterns. Some patterns are designed considering the nature of blockchain and how it can be specifically introduced within real-world applications .

The current traceability solutions suffer from issues such as scattering of information across multiple silos and susceptibility in recording erroneous data and thus are often unable to produce reliable farm to fork stories of products. Blockchain (BC) is a promising technology that could play an important role in providing data transparency and integrity due to its salient features which include decentralisation, immutability and auditability. In this paper, we propose a permissioned blockchain framework which is governed by a consortium of key Food Supply Chain (FSC) entities including government and regulatory bodies to promote food provenance. We propose to use a sharded, three-tiered architecture which ensures availability of data to consumers, limits access to competitive partners and provides scalability for handling transaction load. We also propose a transaction vocabulary and access rights to manage read and write privileges to BC supported by the consortium. The framework, ProductChain, ensures that trade flows are kept confidential when provenance information is retrieved by consumers and stakeholders. Simulation results show that query time for a product ledger is of the order of a few milliseconds even when the information is collated from multiple shards. ProductChain is generalised and applicable to supply chains in diverse industries.},

We now face a critical need for such innovation, as personalization and data science prompt patients to engage in the details of their healthcare and restore agency over their medical data. In this paper, we propose MedRec: a novel, decentralized record management system to handle EMRs, using blockchain technology. Our system gives patients a comprehensive, immutable log and easy access to their medical information across providers and treatment sites. Leveraging unique blockchain properties, MedRec manages authentication, confidentiality, accountability and data sharing - crucial considerations when handling sensitive information. A modular design integrates with providers' existing, local data storage solutions, facilitating interoperability and making our system convenient and adaptable. We incentivize medical stakeholders (researchers, public health authorities, etc.) to participate in the network as blockchain "miners". This provides them with access to aggregate, anonymized data as mining rewards, in return for sustaining and securing the network via Proof of Work. MedRec thus enables the emergence of data economics, supplying big data to empower researchers while engaging patients and providers in the choice to release metadata. The purpose of this short paper is to expose, prior to field tests, a working prototype through which we analyze and discuss our approach.},

abstract = {Since its invention, the public blockchain has attracted more attention from both the academia and industry because of its fully decentralization and persistency features. However, the privacy issue in public blockchain is still challengeable. While there exists privacy preservation mechanisms proposed for the public blockchain, almost all of them can only solve partial of the privacy issue, either user privacy or data privacy indeed, in it. In this work, we present a decentralized access control encryption scheme which ensures user and data privacy simultaneously in public blockchain. With our cryptographic solution, the validity of one specific transaction can be publicly verified, while its content can only be retrieved by its intended receivers. Moreover, the origin of this transaction cannot be identified by any participant except the receivers in the network. Our analysis shows that our solution is really suitable to deploy in public blockchain and is proven secure under mathematical assumptions.},

abstract = {Blockchain is an emerging technology for decentralized and transactional data sharing across a large network of untrusted participants. It enables new forms of distributed software architectures, where components can find agreements on their shared states without trusting a central integration point or any particular participating components. Considering the blockchain as a software connector helps make explicitly important architectural considerations on the resulting performance and quality attributes (for example, security, privacy, scalability and sustainability) of the system. Based on our experience in several projects using blockchain, in this paper we provide rationales to support the architectural decision on whether to employ a decentralized blockchain as opposed to other software solutions, like traditional shared data storage. Additionally, we explore specific implications of using the blockchain as a software connector including design trade-offs regarding quality attributes.},

The use of blockchain technology in wired business environments, such as digital currency systems, offers an interesting solution by creating a way to maintain a distributed shared ledger without requiring a single trusted authority. In this paper, we discuss how a blockchain-based system can be modified to provide a solution for dynamic asset sharing amongst coalition members, enabling the creation of a logically centralized asset management system by a seamless policy-compliant federation of different coalition systems. We discuss the use of blockchain for three different types of assets in a coalition context, showing how blockchain can offer a suitable solution for sharing assets in those environments. We also discuss the limitations in the current implementations of blockchain which need to be overcome for the technology to become more effective in a decentralized tactical edge environment.},

Secure data provenance is crucial for data accountability, forensics and privacy. In this paper, we propose a decentralized and trusted cloud data provenance architecture using blockchain technology. Blockchain-based data provenance can provide tamper-proof records, enable the transparency of data accountability in the cloud, and help to enhance the privacy and availability of the provenance data. We make use of the cloud storage scenario and choose the cloud file as a data unit to detect user operations for collecting provenance data. We design and implement ProvChain, an architecture to collect and verify cloud data provenance, by embedding the provenance data into blockchain transactions. ProvChain operates mainly in three phases: (1) provenance data collection, (2) provenance data storage, and (3) provenance data validation. Results from performance evaluation demonstrate that ProvChain provides security features including tamper-proof provenance, user privacy and reliability with low overhead for the cloud storage applications.},

Current approaches generally only give a hint on whether blockchain technology makes sense for a given use case or not.

Moreover, the centralized storage method is not conducive to the centralized management of traceable data from many enterprises, and there will be problems of low traceability and difficulty in government supervision. The emergence of blockchain technology provides a new solution for data security problems of food traceability, its decentralization, anti-tampering and other characteristics and data encryption technology improve the difficulty of data fraud and ensure data security. If the blockchain is combined with the traceability of agricultural products, the safety of traceable data and the tampering of data can be guaranteed to the greatest extent, the producer's production behavior can be regulated, and consumers' confidence in food quality can be improved. This paper mainly proposes a framework of agricultural product traceability system based on Hyperledger technology, it uses blockchain to store the traceability data of agricultural products safely, and proposes a traceability model of agricultural products, which can cover the entire industrial chain of agricultural products, and consumers can query the authentic source of traceability of agricultural products [1].},

Although, existing blockchain based solutions to provide data integrity verification for semi-Trusted data storages (e.g. cloud providers) cannot respect the time determinism required by Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Additionally, they cannot be applied to resource-constrained IoT devices. We propose an architecture that can take advantage of blockchain features to allow further integrity verification of data produced by IoT devices even in the realm of CPS. Our architecture is divided into three levels, each of them responsible for tasks compatible with their resources capabilities. The first level, composed of sensors, actuators, and gateways, introduces the concept of Proof-of-Trust (PoT), an energy-efficient, time-deterministic and secure communication based on the Trustful Space-Time Protocol (TSTP). Upper levels are responsible for data persistence and integrity verification in the Cloud. The work also comprises a performance evaluation of the critical path of data to demonstrate that the architecture respect time-bounded operations demanded by the sense-decide-Actuate cycle of CPSs. The additional delay of 5.894us added by our architecture is negligible for a typical TSTP with IEEE 802.15.4 radios which has communication latencies in the order of hundreds of milisseconds in each hop.},

abstract = {To protect distributed network resources and assets, collaborative intrusion detection systems/networks (CIDSs/CIDNs) have been widely deployed in various organizations with the purpose of detecting any potential threats. While such systems and networks are usually vulnerable to insider attacks, some kinds of trust mechanisms should be integrated in a real-world application. Challenge-based trust mechanisms are one promising solution, which can measure the trustworthiness of a node by sending challenges to other nodes. In the literature, challenge-based CIDNs have proven to be robust against common insider attacks, but it may still be susceptible to advanced insider attacks. How to further improve the robustness of challenge-based CIDNs remains an issue. Motivated by the recently rapid development of blockchains, in this work, we aim to combine these two and provide a blockchained challenge-based CIDN framework. Our evaluation shows that blockchain technology has the potential to enhance the robustness of challenge-based CIDNs in the aspects of trust management (i.e., enhancing the detection of insider nodes) and alarm aggregation (i.e., identifying untruthful inputs).},

Second, we use SQL-like language as the general interface, instead of code-level APIs, to support convenient application development, in which intrinsic operations are re-defined and re-implemented to suit for blockchain platform. Third, as RDBMS has achieved great success in the past decades, our system, though not relying on RDBMS, treats it as an important component.

As blockchain technologies, especially permissioned networks, find more applicability beyond cryptocurrencies in enterprise solutions, it is expected that the security requirements will increase. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an access control system that works in a decentralized environment without compromising the unique features of a blockchain. A straightforward method to support access control is to deploy a firewall in front of the enterprise blockchain application. However, this approach does not take advantage of the desirable features of blockchain. In order to address these concerns, we propose a novel blockchain-based access control scheme, which keeps the decentralization feature for access control–related operations. The newly proposed system also provides the capability to protect user's privacy by leveraging ring signature. We implement a prototype of the scheme using Hyperledger Fabric and assess its performance to show that it is practical for real-world applications.},

Furthermore, the authorisation, encryption, and decryption algorithms proposed in the GAA-FQ scheme dispense with the need to use a public key infrastructure (PKI) and hence improve the computation performance needed to support more granular and distributed, yet authorised, EMR data queries. We validated the computation performance and transmission efficiency for GAA-FQ using a simulation of GAA-FQ against an access control scheme for EMRs called ESPAC as our baseline that was not designed using a Blockchain.

abstract = {Existing data storage systems offer a wide range of functionalities to accommodate an equally diverse range of applications. However, new classes of applications have emerged, e.g., blockchain and collaborative analytics, featuring data versioning, fork semantics, tamper-evidence or any combination thereof. They present new opportunities for storage systems to efficiently support such applications by embedding the above requirements into the storage. In this paper, we present ForkBase, a storage engine designed for blockchain and forkable applications. By integrating core application properties into the storage, ForkBase not only delivers high performance but also reduces development effort. The storage manages multiversion data and supports two variants of fork semantics which enable different fork worklflows. ForkBase is fast and space efficient, due to a novel index class that supports efficient queries as well as effective detection of duplicate content across data objects, branches and versions. We demonstrate ForkBase's performance using three applications: a blockchain platform, a wiki engine and a collaborative analytics application. We conduct extensive experimental evaluation against respective state-of-the-art solutions. The results show that ForkBase achieves superior performance while significantly lowering the development effort.},

In this paper, we propose a new framework for access control in IoT based on the blockchain technology. Our first contribution consists in providing a reference model for our proposed framework within the Objectives, Models, Architecture and Mechanism specification in IoT. In addition, we introduce FairAccess as a fully decentralized pseudonymous and privacy preserving authorization management framework that enables users to own and control their data. To implement our model, we use and adapt the blockchain into a decentralized access control manager. Unlike financial bitcoin transactions, FairAccess introduces new types of transactions that are used to grant, get, delegate, and revoke access. As a proof of concept, we establish an initial implementation with a Raspberry PI device and local blockchain. Finally, we discuss some limitations and propose further opportunities.

By using blockchain and designing towards security, originChain provides transparent tamper-proof traceability data with high availability and enables automated regulatory-compliance checking and adaptation in product traceability scenarios. We also demonstrate both qualitative and quantitative analysis of the software architecture of originChain.

Furthermore, it focuses on the unique challenges involved in designing the trust models for social Internet of vehicles. Several trust models exist in literature; however, most of the existing trust models are specific to their domains, for example, Internet of things, social Internet of things, or general vehicular networks. This article presents a brief review of the trust models that have the potential to be implemented in Social Internet of vehicles. Finally, the authors present an overview of how trending concepts and emerging technologies like blockchain and fog computing can assist in developing a trust-based social Internet of vehicles model for high-efficiency, decentralized architecture and dynamic nature of vehicular networks.},

However, it is facing two challenges, one is that data in centralized repositories needs to be separated from social web applications that force users to share their information. In addition, a decentralized authentication that guarantees who can operate on user's data with a secure privacy protection is another significant issue. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing a blockchain-based decentralized data storage and authentication scheme for Solid, termed BCSolid, in which a user's data can be independent of multiple web applications and can switch data storage service easily without relying on a trusted third party. Meanwhile, our scheme gurantees data ownership and user's privacy by leveraging the blockchain miners to perform authentication with the help of certificateless cryptography. Additionally, we present a possible instantiation to illustrate how “transactions” in BCSolid are processed. To our knowledge this is the first work to promote the Solid project using blockchain. The evaluation results show that our scheme can gurantee a low latency network and is a promising solution to Solid.},

abstract = {As the fundamental component of blockchains, proof-of-work (PoW) scheme has been widely leveraged to provide consensus for maintaining a distributed public ledger. However, the long confirmation time, and hence the slow finality rate, is far from satisfactory. Alternative paradigms with performance improvement emerge. Nevertheless, there are fewer attempts in modifying the PoW mechanism itself. We find that the slow finality rate in PoW is caused by using only one bit to measure the computational power, namely, whether the attained hash value is smaller than a given target. In this paper, we first propose Demo-of-Work (DoW), a generalized PoW which assigns the computational work with a score depending on the hash value. We also treat the bitcoin blockchain as a global “clock” to attain synchronization for ensuring that each participant takes part in DoW for roughly the same time interval for ensuring fairness. With these two tools, we construct an alternative blockchain called AB-chain which provides a significantly faster finality rate when compared with the existing PoW-based blockchains, without sacrificing communication complexity or fairness.},

With the proposed DPS, users can preserve important data in perpetuity, and the originality of the data can be verified if tampering is suspected. In addition, we use prudent data storage strategies and a variety of cryptographic algorithms to guarantee user privacy; e.g., an adversary is unable to read the plain text even if the data are stolen. We implement a prototype of the DPS based on the real world blockchain-based platform Ethereum. Performance evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed system.},

The traditional centralized digital copyright protection system based on centralized authority management of authoritative organizations has high registration cost. Blockchain, as a decentralized protocol, has the characteristics of decentralization, anonymity, auditability, security and persistency, which provide a solution to the current problems in the field of digital copyright. Combining with blockchain technology, this paper proposes a digital copyright registration and transaction system with double chain architecture. The blockchain based on digital copyright registration and management chain (RMC) and digital copyright transaction and subscription chain (TSC) can prevent information disclosure and improve the privacy protection by segregating account information and transaction information. Meanwhile, transforming the previous one-chain architecture into multiple chains in parallel on the RMC and TSC can reduce the redundant amount of computation, the consensus efficiency and improve the throughput rate. Experimental analysis shows that the system has the advantages of short registration time, high throughput and good scalability.},

This can result in compromising the home network, as well as large scale attacks such as the recent Mirai network of botnets that was used in a DDoS attack. The problem is that end users have a hard time assessing the risks induced by connected devices, and often lack the skills and time to administrate their home network. We answer the above challenge by proposing STewARD, a solution that allows users to easily request from their intelligent home network controller the creation of isolated software-defined network slices, to which they assign a required trust level using very simple risk assessment. We build a global trust assessment framework that computes a trust score for each class of devices, based on reported history stored in a blockchain. Network controllers can then leverage this information to connect to slices only those devices that meet the expected trust levels, and can contribute to the crowd-sourced reporting by monitoring the devices' behaviors compared to an expected baseline.},

The blockchain network reduces the dependency of centralized and turning into decentralized network in the Web 3.0 era. In the decentralized network, the threat of data breaching can be eliminated where none of party has the authority to control over user digital badges in education. In this case, all the data will be distributed over the whole network. Furthermore, the weak vulnerability of Internet of Things (IoT) toward Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) has stimulated the development of blockchain technology as a solution. Blockchain technology has released a computer program as smart contract with the generation of token to authorize the flow of user into IoT network for strengthen the security and privacy of IoT network. Last but not least, the challenge to develop an effective blockchain network is the most challenging task since it requires deep understanding of blockchain technology.},

abstract = {Blockchain-based applications usually consist of centralized elements (e.g., web servers and back-end logic) connected to decentralized elements such as smart contracts. The engineering of such hybrid software architectures poses a challenge as it is unclear which elements should be centralized or decentralized. Furthermore the impact of this decision (or the balance between those two areas) on software quality attributes such as security, maintainability, performance or costs is currently unknown. The goal is to build a software architecture using the benefits and handling the challenges of blockchain technology while fulfilling the relevant quality attributes. While there are several approaches examining the relation between architectural decisions and quality attributes in centralized systems, research is at an early stage for decentralized elements in software architectures. This paper presents a first step towards architectural blockchain tactics. With a simplified experiment comparing two implementation variants of an Ethereum smart contract we show that software design patterns are not always beneficial and that the expected usage scenarios have a strong impact on the operational costs. We argue that further research and validation is necessary for gaining more qualitative and quantitative insights to make informed architectural design decisions when using blockchain technology and give a first outline on how to achieve this.},

The blockchain, as an effective technology for decentralized distributed storage and security management, has already showed great advantages in its application of Bitcoin. In this paper, we investigate how the blockchain technology could be extended to the application of vehicle networking, especially with the consideration of the distributed and secure storage of big data. We define several types of nodes such as vehicle and roadside for vehicle networks and form several sub-blockchain networks.

abstract = {Process Mining (PM) is a special data mining technique that allows extracting information from data of critical transactions (i.e. event logs) carried out in Information Systems and monitors the patterns in these transactions. When we start to process event logs with process mining tools, we face with data quality problems such as incorrect and insufficient logging and timing. Thus, data cleaning operations must be applied to event logs before applying process mining on these logs. Being an innovative medium of distributed data processing and storage with the features of enhanced security, traceability, automated transaction verification and integration, Blockchain Technology and Smart Contracts might be a good option to process and store event logs for process mining. In this paper, we focused on the cleaning of the event logs by smart contract as data is flowing from the information systems into the blockchain, and used Hyperledger Composer by IBM to develop our solution. We tested our proposal on an open process data of 1555 records, and compared the cleaning performance of our proposal with that of DataWrangler by Stanford University. Our proposal not only cleaned all 1313 records identified and cleaned by DataWrangler, it also saved 12 additional records with a different date format that was caught and corrected by our smart contract implementation.},

abstract = {Architectural design patterns (ADPs) are architectural solutions to common architectural design problems. They are an important concept in software architectures used for the design and analysis of architectures. An ADP usually constrains the design of an architecture and, in turn, guarantees some desired properties for architectures implementing it. Sometimes, however, the constraints imposed by an ADP do not lead to the claimed guarantee. Thus, applying such patterns for the design of architectures might result in architectures which do not fulfill their intended requirements. To address this problem, we propose an approach for the verification of ADPs, based on interactive theorem proving. To this end, we introduce a model for dynamic architectures and alanguage for the specification of ADPs over this model. Moreover, we propose a framework for the interactiveverification of such specifications based on Isabelle/HOL. In addition we describe an algorithm to map a specification to a corresponding Isabelle/HOL theory over our framework. To evaluate the approach, we implement it inEclipse/EMF and use it for the verification of four ADPs: variants of the Singleton, the Publisher-Subscriber, theBlackboard pattern, and a pattern for Blockchain architectures. With our approach we complement traditionalapproaches for the verification of architectures, which are usually based on automatic verification techniquessuch as model checking.},

IoT applications practiced in myriad phases include human life, ecological supervise, public wellbeing and medical behavior, smart shipping, traffic monitoring, smart cities, smart home applications, smart grid, and others. Mostly Internet of Things maintained with various sensing devices and technologies such as Sensors, GPS (Global positioning system), laser sensor, gas inductor, RFID (Radio-frequency identification devices), infrared sensor and many more, which collects large range features from the real world and send abstract feature objects which need to be monitored. Most of the devices are linked and interacted with more than one. The main idea behind IoT is to connect device-to-device, device-to-human, human-to-human. Development of IoT can make people live in a convenient way; however, it does not make sure the security of secret confidential information of its user. With a great collection of distribution, responsiveness and somewhat high processing capacity of IoT objects formed them as an optimal objective for cyber-attacks. So here some probabilities, secret confidential information may be a leak or stolen some point in time. Just once a sign of IoT device is captured or suspended it intention straightforwardly perturbs the security about whole information of IoT. Moreover, enormous IoT nodes accumulate a large amount of extensive prosperous, private information and process it, so its like lottery for cyber attackers to steal entire important data. Security obstacles like privacy, secure communication, access control, safe storage of data are becoming important tackles in the IoT domain. Hence, each solitary node that we positioned, each solitary device that we discover, each solitary byte that generated within the sphere of an IoT domain, at some point of time comes under inspection in the course of the investigation. An IoT not including proper premeditated solutions for security issues it will principally limit its improvement.

Blockchain is one of the new information technologies supporting the development of management information system. It provides a solution for the storage, verification, transmission, and exchange of distributed data. To optimize the communication performance from two aspects of communication topology and communication mechanism, a multi-link and concurrent communication tree model was constructed. To improve blockchain communication technology, an interactive design method based on big data rule mining and blockchain communication technology was proposed, which mainly solved the optimization of transmission performance of blockchain data. On the basis of ensuring the stability and reliability of data transmission, the efficiency of data transmission in blockchain was further optimized, and the integrated factor communication tree algorithm (IFT) was proposed. To solve the influence of transmission delay between nodes on communication performance, a multi-link multifactor weighted communication tree algorithm (MMWT) considering weight was proposed. Moreover, to improve the efficiency of data communication, ensure the reliability of transmission, and improve the fairness of service in the blockchain, different strategies for optimizing the performance of data communication in the blockchain were proposed under the constraints of factors such as node communication ability, node trust, weight, and service request priority. Finally, the simulation results showed that MMWT algorithm had good communication performance in concurrent communication time, communication tree reliability, communication tree depth, and other aspects.},

This paper presents a universal framework for a blockchain platform that enables peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading in the retail electricity market. Focusing attention on seeking energy-matching pairs from the supply and demand sides, and encouraging direct energy trading between producers and consumers, the P2P energy trading mechanism is proposed. The designed multidimensional blockchain platform implements a complete energy trading process. As smart contracts strictly execute the trading and payment rules without human interaction, the security and fairness of energy trading are significantly enhanced. Case studies in the Ethereum private chain demonstrate that the proposed mechanism has obvious advantages in reflecting market quotations, balancing profits of players, and facilitating the utilization of renewables. Based on such characteristics, players are incentivized to participate in the P2P energy trading. Moreover, the authentic gas consumption and computational time to the smart contract indicate that this platform is able to achieve an efficient and effective transaction with multi-player participation.},

abstract = {The emerging Blockchain (BC) and Distributed Ledger technologies have come to impact a variety of domains, from capital market sectors to digital asset management in the Internet of Things (IoT). As a result, more and more BC-based decentralized applications for numerous cross-domain services have been developed. These applications implement specialized decentralized computer programs called Smart Contracts (SCs) which are deployed into BC frameworks. Although these SCs are open ato public, it is challenging to discover and utilize such SCs for a wide range of usages from both systems and end-users because such SCs are already compiled in form of byte-codes without any associated meta-data. This motivates us to propose a solution called Semantic SC (SSC) which integrates RESTful semantic web technologies in SCs, deployed on the Ethereum Blockchain platform, for indexing, browsing and annotating such SCs. The solution also exposes the relevant distributed ledgers as Linked Data for enhancing the discovery capability. To achieve this goal, the OWL-S service ontology is extended by incorporating some domain specific terminologies, which are used in the development of the proposed SSCs. As a result, SSC can be utilized to enrich queries for a domain-specific terms across multiple distributed ledgers, which greatly increases the discovery capability of decentralized IoT applications and services. Contribution in standardization is also discussed. We believe that our research work takes the first steps towards connecting BC-based decentralized services with semantic web services in order to provide better IoT ecosystems.},

There are many opportunities to examine the utilization of blockchain technology to be used in developing systems as needed. This paper summarizes the conditions of blockchain research in terms of technology and its implementation. This paper was written using a systematic literature review (SLR) as one of the methodologies used to solve problems by tracing the results of previous studies. The problem that you want to study in SLR is usually referred to as a research question (RQ). The defined RQ is related to the topic and clarifies each question by tracing previous research papers indexed in reputable journal databases such as IEEE Xplore, Springerlink, Scopus, and ScienceDirect. After synthesizing 41 articles, the result is: blockchain can be used in many applications, some applications that adopt blockchain technology are banking applications, e-voting applications and digital forensic applications. Often, applications that use blockchain technology only focus on developing one of the blockchain technologies that suits their needs. Some developers maximize the components of the contract on the blockchain, some further develop the data structure of the blockchain itself. The use of blockchain technology is still wide open for the implementation of other information systems. The expected contribution of this paper is to provide a general overview for researchers who want to build applications that use blockchain as a basis for researching so they can conduct further studies to better understand whether the applications they will develop are suitable for using blockchain technology as a basis.},

More specifically the decentralized nature of BC makes it apt for integration with the IoT networks. In this paper, we propose a model that makes use of the blockchain concept to bridle the security and authentication problems in the IoT network. We consider various factors that effect this integration of blockchain and IoT. Our investigations conclude that this hybrid model is powerful and can provide significant transformations in building novel applications across distributed platforms.},

abstract = {For the successful development of the astrophysics and, accordingly, for obtaining more complete knowledge of the Universe, it is extremely important to combine and comprehensively analyze information of various types (e.g., about charged cosmic particles, gamma rays, neutrinos, etc.) obtained by using divers large-scale experimental setups located throughout the world. It is obvious that all kinds of activities must be performed continually across all stages of the data life cycle to help support effective data management, in particular, the collection and storage of data, its processing and analysis, refining the physical model, making preparations for publication, and data reprocessing taking refinement into account. In this paper we present a general approach to construction and the architecture of a system to be able to collect, store, and provide users' access to astrophysical data. We also suggest a new approach to the construction of a metadata registry based on the blockchain technology.},

abstract = {The digitization of health records has massively increased Health Information Exchange (HIE) activities among different practitioners, but it has lagged behind Electronic Health/Medical Records (EHRs/EMRs) adoption for numerous reasons, including confidentiality, interoperability, integrity, and privacy-related concerns. In this paper, we present a Blockchainas-a-Service based solution for HIE (BaaS-HIE). In particular, our design work involves the use of a private Blockchain and smart contracts as access control manager to medical records. In order to maintain high level of performance for applications, thus that such applications could be economically viable, all of the health data are encrypted and stored into a decentralised InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and the hash of the assets URI is stored in blockchain. Our experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach in offering a decentralized and fine-grained accessibility mechanism for the patient and the doctor in a given healthcare system.},

@article{Ling_2020,
abstract = {The explosion of Internet of Things (IoT) applications makes the existing network structure insufficient because it is split by multiple non-cooperative operators, does not scale with the future development of IoT, and calls for novel networking concepts and protocols. The need for multi-operator IoT paradigms poses some unprecedented challenges, including trust considerations. To enable a multi-operator network without shared authentication, we propose a trustworthy grant-free IoT access protocol named Hash Access by leveraging a blockchain radio access network (B-RAN) architecture. B-RAN re-organizes multiple individual radio access networks into a joint multi-operator network based on a blockchain. B-RAN can establish trust among initially trustless operators and efficiently utilize resources across networks, matching and creating values for multiple participants. Furthermore, to mitigate the loss of network efficiency caused by selfish behavior among untrustworthy IoT devices, the proposed protocol can induce IoT devices to follow an access rule and control their data traffic. The proposed framework unifies the IoT access and the underlying B-RAN to reduce confirmation delays in traditional blockchains significantly. Numerical experiments illustrate the performance edge for the B-RAN-enabled Hash Access.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose an access control solution for exchanging Blockchain-based Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) called BBACS (Block-based Access Control Scheme) that includes an access model and an access scheme. Unlike the existing Blockchain-oriented access schemes for EMRs, our access model can omit the agent layer (gateway) in order to authorise users' access with block level granularity, whilst maintaining compatibility with the underlying Blockchain data structure. Furthermore, the authorisation, encryption, and decryption algorithms presented in BBACS dispense with the need to use a public key infrastructure (PKI) and hence cut down the cost of network construction and improve the computational performance. We validated the efficiency (time cost) of local computation and data transmission (over Wi-Fi) for BBACS using a simulation of BBACS against another Blockchain-oriented access control scheme for EMRs called HDG as our baseline. To the best of our knowledge, BBACS is the first Blockchain-oriented access control solution without the need for an agent (or gateway) design, supporting granular authorisation (block level), that has been proposed for secure EMRs management in eHealth.},

In this paper, we review existing work on the use of blockchain technology to support business processes with a focus on cross-organizational settings. Based on this, we suggest to view blockchain as a software connector helping organizations to integrate the IT systems they use to support business processes. In addition, this paper suggests to use a model-driven engineering approach for the development of such connectors. By doing so, the need to develop a methodology helping to model and implement blockchain-based software connectors supporting cross-organizational business processes is highlighted. By adopting such an approach, organizations would be able to facilitate and speed up the development of blockchain-based solutions. This in turn would facilitate experimentations with this technology, which is considered as an important phase for organizations to derive value from it.},

@article{Turk_2017,
abstract = {Blockchain technology enables distributed, encrypted and secure logging of digital transactions. It is the underlying technology of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Blockchain is expected to revolutionize computing in several areas, particularly where centralization was unnatural and privacy was important. In the paper, we present research on where and how this technology could be useful in the construction industry. The work is based on the study of literature on open issues that exist in construction process management. These are than matched to the capabilities of blockchain. We are motivated by the fact that construction projects involve a dynamic grouping of several companies. We study the degree to which the relationships among them are hierarchical or peer-to-peer and note that particularly in information intensive phases, centralization of information management was necessary because of technology. When using un-constraining technology, communication patterns among participants show a peer-to-peer nature of the relationships. In such environment, blockchain can provide a trustworthy infrastructure for information management during all building life-cycle stages. Even if building information modelling (BIM) is used, which assumes a centralized building information model, there is a role for blockchain to manage information on who did what and when and thus provide a basis for any legal arguments that might occur. On the construction site blockchain can improve the reliability and trustworthiness of construction logbooks, works performed and material quantities recorded. In the facility maintenance phase, blockchain's main potential is the secure storage of sensor data which are sensitive to privacy. We conclude that blockchain provides solutions to many current problems in construction information management. However, it is more likely that it will be built into generic IT infrastructure on top of which construction applications are built, rather than used directly by authors of construction related software. It has a potential to make construction processes less centralized which opens needs for research in that direction.},

@article{Wang_2020,
abstract = {Bitcoin security draws more and more attention recently. One of Bitcoin vulnerabilities is caused by ECDSA weak randomness. A random number is not cryptographically secure, which leads to private key leakage and even fund theft. This security problem has been well known in Bitcoin community and fixed by applying RFC 6979 update in 2013. In this paper, we systematically revisit the cases where random numbers are reused and evaluate them based on practical Bitcoin transactions. After analyzing Bitcoin transaction dataset from January 2009 to July 2017, we find that there are still approximately 0.48 percent of transactions involving this vulnerability, and 1331 private keys have been compromised. In addition, the transactions related to some involved addresses have a common pattern, which gives us a clue that a spam transaction attack may take advantage of ECDSA weak randomness. We also examine mainstream Bitcoin software wallets to check whether they are susceptible to ECDSA weak randomness. Even the result is quite optimistic, an example that one of the influenced addresses leaked in April 2014 is still in use again in August 2017 reflects that the severity of ECDSA weak randomness may not be paid enough attention even after its discovery and solution in 2013.},

abstract = {Secure and scalable data sharing is essential for collaborative clinical decision making. Conventional clinical data efforts are often siloed, however, which creates barriers to efficient information exchange and impedes effective treatment decision made for patients. This paper provides four contributions to the study of applying blockchain technology to clinical data sharing in the context of technical requirements defined in the “Shared Nationwide Interoperability Roadmap” from the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC). First, we analyze the ONC requirements and their implications for blockchain-based systems. Second, we present FHIRChain, which is a blockchain-based architecture designed to meet ONC requirements by encapsulating the HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard for shared clinical data. Third, we demonstrate a FHIRChain-based decentralized app using digital health identities to authenticate participants in a case study of collaborative decision making for remote cancer care. Fourth, we highlight key lessons learned from our case study.},
